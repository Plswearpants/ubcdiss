\chapter{STM Measurements of PtSn\textsubscript{4}}
PtSn\textsubscript{4} presents two particularly intriguing aspects: its exotic band topology and its unusual transport properties. On the one hand, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has revealed Dirac node–arc states on its surface, placing PtSn\textsubscript{4} within the family of topological semimetals\cite{wuDiracNodeArcs2016}. On the other hand, its bulk transport is remarkable, with an extremely large residual resistivity ratio (RRR) often exceeding 1000 and a correspondingly low residual resistivity in the nanohm–centimeter range\cite{munMagneticFieldEffects2012, perevalovaFeaturesElectronicTransport2022, diazSemiclassicalOriginExtreme2024}. Such transport behavior indicates minimal defect scattering at low temperatures, which could stem from the scarcity of scattering centers in high-quality crystals or from the suppression of backscattering expected in certain topological band structures\cite{roushanTopologicalSurfaceStates2009, kimRobustProtectionBackscattering2014, ivanovAbsenceBackscatteringFermiarc2024}. However, recent studies, including the present work, suggest that these extraordinary transport properties are not directly tied to the nodal-arc states, but instead arise primarily from semiclassical mechanisms\cite{diazSemiclassicalOriginExtreme2024}. This distinction underscores the importance of PtSn\textsubscript{4} as a platform for \ac{STM} studies of individual defects and their scattering processes, offering a unique opportunity to disentangle the respective roles of crystal perfection and band topology in shaping macroscopic transport.

In this chapter, we present a defect characterization study of PtSn\textsubscript{4} using our low-temperature Createc \ac{STM}. Multiple types of defects were identified and their distinct topographic and electronic signatures documented. To quantitatively assess the densities of different defect types, we developed a multinomial statistical model. This model not only provided estimates of defect-specific densities but also enabled a rigorous treatment of the associated statistical uncertainties. The validity of the model was carefully examined and discussed. Our analysis reveals that the defect-specific densities in PtSn\textsubscript{4} are extremely low, indicating that its unusually small residual resistivity arises from classical origins.

\section{Crystal and electronic structures of PtSn\textsubscript{4}}

PtSn\textsubscript{4} crystallizes in the orthorhombic Ccca structure (space group No. 68). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:crystal_struc} panel a), PtSn\textsubscript{4} crystal consists of quasi-two-dimensional Sn–Pt–Sn sandwiches stacked along the crystallographic b axis. Each layer is composed of a square lattice of Pt atoms encapsulated by Sn layers, forming edge-sharing PtSn\textsubscript{8} antiprisms. This structural motif hints a layered system with weak interlayer bonding; however, it is experimentally confirmed that the electronic structure of PtSn\textsubscript{4} is highly three-dimensional, with non-trivial K\textsubscript{z} dispersion of Fermi surfaces  \cite{wuDiracNodeArcs2016,linUltrafastCarrierRelaxation2024,inamdarQuantumOscillationsUltra2013a,munMagneticFieldEffects2012,yaraSmallFermiSurfaces2018a,diazSemiclassicalOriginExtreme2024}; Moreover, it is also shown that both Pt and Sn orbitals contribute on a similar level to the carrier pockets across Fermi-level, with significant hybridization\cite{luoOriginExtremelyLarge2018}. 

This hybrid character, structurally layered but electronically three-dimensional, leaves two potential points worth considering in the subsequent \ac{STM} study. First, the metallic interlayer coupling may complicate the cleaving process. Unlike van der Waals layered materials that cleave cleanly along weakly bonded planes, PtSn$_4$ has metallic Sn–Sn bonds between its Sn–Pt–Sn sandwiches. As a result, cleavage may not always yield a uniform termination, and indeed, both Sn- and Pt-terminated surfaces were observed in a previous study\cite{liDiracNodalArc2019}. Extra care was given in identifying the exposed layer, and it was later identified that the majority of the surface is Sn terminated. Secondly, Since \ac{STM} is inherently a surface-sensitive probe, its spectroscopic signals are usually interpreted as an average over momentum along the out-of-plane direction ($k_z$). This approximation works well in electronically quasi-2D systems, where $k_z$ dispersion is negligible. In PtSn$_4$, however, the pronounced $k_z$ dependence of the band structure complicates this picture: STM measurements no longer reflect a simple slice of the Fermi surface, but rather a projection that mixes contributions from different $k_z$ states. Addressing this challenge may require specialized approaches, such as $k_z$-selective techniques developed in recent tomographic studies \cite{marquesTomographicMappingHidden2021}.

Figure. \ref{fig:crystal_struc} panel c) shows a typical PtSn\textsubscript{4} crystal used in the study; it is featured by well-defined rectangular facets along the crystallographic b-axis. The crystals are grown by our collaborator Samikshya Sahu with a standard self-flux method with excess Sn. X-ray diffraction was performed on a crystal in the same batch as the one in c), and the refinement confirmed the orthorhombic Ccca structure and shows high crystalline quality. The high quality of the samples was further confirmed by temperature-dependent resistivity measurements, which yielded residual resistivity ratio (RRR) values exceeding 1000, as shown in the two S1 datasets in panel e). All samples were grown using the self-flux method with identical starting stoichiometry and elemental purity; the only variable was the cooling rate, defined by the total cooling time and indicated in the figure legends. It is worth noting that even under deliberately unfavorable growth conditions designed to increase disorder, PtSn\textsubscript{4} crystals retain RRR values well above 100, far surpassing the benchmarks of most metals.

Within each layer, square antiprismatic PtSn\textsubscript{8} units share edges, as seen along the b-axis. The two crystallographically equivalent Sn positions, Sn\textsubscript{a} and Sn\textsubscript{b}, can appear as distinct surface terminations upon cleaving.

\section{Sample surface Preparation}
\par Sample surface preparation is one of the keys to a successful STM experiment. As the surface of the sample is what we are trying to probe, making sure the surface is as clean and stable as possible is usually the goal of sample preparation. 

\par We achieve a clean and stable crystal surface via in-situ cleaving, it is worth mentioning that prior to the successful room-temperature cleaving, we did 2 trials of low-temperature cleaving at around 20K and the they failed, thus we will elaborate the in-situ root-temperature cleaving we performed. We first prepare the sample on bench, a mushroom like sample holder made of oxygen free copper is used. We can see a stacking structure on the left of \ref{fig:ch4_cleaves} a), from bottom to top the components are sample holder, a Pt-sheet, PtSn$_4$ single crystal, a cylindrical MACOR ceramic post. Each component is attached to the neighbors via EPO-TEK H20E, a silver-filled epoxy with low contact resistance. A polycrystalline gold is mounted next to the assembly serving as a reference metal and a tip cleaning surface. 

\par As discussed in Section 3.1, despite having a layered structure, the inter-layer bonding of PtSn$\textsubscript{4}$ is not merely weak van der Waals force, but rather metallic, making PtSn$_4$ not easily cleavable. To increase the success rate, a flat Molybdenum (Mo) sheet is mounted as a buffer layer between the sample holder and the crystal. The copper sample holder has a rough surface with some residual of silver epoxy which is hard to remove, the Mo-sheets offers a cleaner interface for the epoxy polymer-network to form. And the downside of having another epoxy layer between copper sample holder and the sheet is compensated by the large Cu-Mo interface area. Therefore, cleaving on Mo-sheet gives a larger chance for a successful cleave and thus lays the foundation for the \ac{STM} experiments in this study. It is also worth mentioning that all silver epoxies are cured at the same optimal condition for good consistency. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Ch4_cleaving.pdf}

(b) Post-cleaving surface imaged with a K2 camera, showing large shiny regions and a central crack. (c,d) Pre-cleaving setup of the second trial with dual samples, S1 (left) and S2 (right).

(d) Post-cleaving image shows both samples with shiny flat areas and some cracks.}
	\label{fig:ch4_cleaves}
\end{figure}

\par The sample holder is then mounted to the sample plate and transferred into the preparation chamber, which sits at a pressure near $10^{-10}$ mbar and at room-temperature. We then drove one of our arms horizontally towards the downward facing sample-post assembly with directions indicated as red arrows shown in a) and c) of \ref{fig:ch4_cleaves}, the cleaving results are shown in b) and d), where we inspected the crystal in-situ with a K2 long distance optical microscope right after the cleave. The cleaving was successful as the cleaved crystals reveals large shiny areas. Some surface cracks were present but were carefully avoided during tip landing. It is worth noting that two attempts at in-situ low-temperature cleaving at T \textasciitilde 20 K were made but were unsuccessful, likely because the interlayer bonding of the crystal remained stronger than the crystal–epoxy–post adhesion at low temperature.

%todo: rearrange this paragrah to talk about the sample and cleaving conditions. need to modify later sections to make sure the terms are consistent. 
\par In total, our data was collected in 2 experiments on two samples with different growth conditions. While both samples used flux growth technique with the same initial stoichiometry and heating profile, their cooling rate from the highest dwelling temperature to the targeted spinning temperature is different. As shown in table \ref{table:sample}, sample S1 is cooled slowly with a rate of 4 \degree C/hr and S2 is cooled much faster at 20 \degree C/hr. A faster cooling rate generally result in an increased density of defects; the main reason being that the atoms in the crystal lattice has less time to diffuse and reorder into their lowest-energy configuration, and thus result in incomplete relaxation and trapping of defects. This is also indicated in the \ac{RRR} of two samples, where \ac{RRR} of S1 is significant higher than that of the S2. This shows S1 has a much lower level of impurity-electron scattering.
In \ac{STM} experiment, we should specify the cleaving surface as well as the sample. The first \ac{STM} experiment was performed on S1$_a$, as shown in a) of \ref{fig:ch4_cleaves}, the second experiment is on a dual sample plate, on which S1 and S2 are mounted side by side, as shown in c) of \ref{fig:ch4_cleaves}. This allows us to scan surface S1$_b$ and S2$_a$ with the same tip condition, enhancing our ability to make a better comparison.

\section{Topography overview}
\par In the course of the study of PtSn$_4$, we went through several phases, with the first phase being about the surface exploration, termination determination, scanning parameter optimization, and some spectroscopy measurements conducted on S1$_a$. The second phase was conducted on S1$_b$ and S2$_a$, with the focus on characterizing the defect scattering behaviors on both surfaces through topography and spectroscopy measurements. This section will cover the topographical aspect of this study. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption[\textbf{Pristine topography on PtSn\textsubscript{4}}]{\textbf{Pristine topography on PtSn\textsubscript{4}}(a)Typical STM topography of PtSn$_4$, characterized by waffle-like square corrugations and sparse defects at different atomic sites. (b) Overlay of the Pt layer on the topography, which aligns perfectly with the observed square corrugations.}
	\label{fig:ch4_pristinetopo}
\end{figure}

\par In total, we took over 20000 STM topographies in this study, covering an area of over two million nanometer squared. More specifically, we acquired around 10000 images on 5 macroscopic spots on the S1$_a$ surface, around 5000 images on the S1$_a$ surface, and around 2000 images on 2 macroscopic spots on the S2$_a$ surface. 
Panel a) of \ref{fig:ch4_pristinetopo} exhibits a typical STM topography on PtSn$_4$, it is featured by waffle-like square corrugations and sparse defects at different atomic sites. Pristine cleaved surfaces are remarkably defect free, which we quantify through a careful statistical analysis in a subsequent section. We can overlay the Pt-layer to the surface of the pristine surface as shown in b) of \ref{fig:ch4_pristinetopo} and it maps perfectly with the square corrugations we observed. The square corrugation is dark with lower contrast, which hints that Pt layer not being the outermost layer. However, as mentioned in Ch.2, the tunneling current of STM has both the contribution of distance and electronic structure of the sample, the pattern revealed on topography is not necessarily the top most surface. To determine on what termination we are scanning, we ran a full terrace characterization.


\subsection{Terrace determination}
%todo: to insert the pdf showing potential cleavin9g planes of PtSn4.
\par Topographies of PtSn$_4$ reveal flat terraces that belong to different cleavage planes. Inspecting the crystal structure of PtSn$_4$, we note that there are three possible cleavage planes as shown in Fig 2. They are Sn$_a$-Pt, Pt-Sn$_b$, and Sn$_b$-Sn$_a$. Sn$_b$-Sn$_a$ bond has twice the length as Sn$_a$-Pt and Pt-Sn$_b$ bond and thus is weaker. We expect this material to cleave predominately between Sn$_b$-Sn$_a$.

	\label{fig:ch4_termination}
\end{figure}

\par In the experiment, we often landed our tips on a dominating terrace that is big and flat, and by scanning the step edges of the terraces, we could also see other terminations but with much less occurrence. To determine the dominating terrace we are scanning, we analyzed the step heights on a step-edge area, as shown in \ref{fig:ch4_termination}. 

Before discussing the result shown in panel (b) of Figure \ref{fig:ch4_termination}, it is useful to recall how cleaving modifies the sample structure. Cleaving breaks the translational symmetry of the crystal, with the strongest effect on the surface layer. When the covering layers are replaced by vacuum, the surface layer can either “relax” inward or outward from the bulk. In systems with metallic inter-layer bonding, the surface layer normally relaxes inward \cite{okazawaEnhancedCorrelatedThermal2005}. This relaxation reduces the distance between the topmost layer and the layer beneath it compared to the bulk lattice spacing. The extent of this relaxation depends on the cleavage plane and its local bonding environment.

In PtSn$_4$, there are two possible Sn-terminated surfaces. If the surface ends at an Sn$_a$ layer (from an Sn$_b$–Sn$_a$ cleave), the relaxation is relatively small. In contrast, if the surface ends at an Sn$_b$ layer (from a Pt–Sn$_b$ cleave), the relaxation is stronger. As a result, the apparent step height between Sn$_a$ and Sn$_b$ terminations is expected to differ from the bulk lattice spacing of 2.8{\AA} (one-quarter of the unit cell along the $b$-axis): it will appear larger than 2.8{\AA} for an Sn$_a$–Sn$_b$ step, and smaller than 2.8{\AA} for an Sn$_b$–Sn$_a$ step. This prediction matches the step-height profiles we measured, shown in panel (b) of Figure \ref{fig:ch4_termination}. The height histogram extracted from the topography displays distinct peaks corresponding to different terminations. From this analysis, we conclude that the vast majority of the surface is Sn$_a$-terminated. Other terminations, corresponding to the Pt or Sn$_b$ layers, were rare, accounting for less than 1\% of the total scanned area.

\section{Defect Analysis}
Defects play a central role in determining the low-temperature transport properties of a material. At cryogenic temperatures, electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering are strongly suppressed, leaving electron-defect scattering as the dominant contribution to the residual resistivity. A detailed characterization of the real-space features, spectroscopic signatures, and densities of existing types of defect is therefore essential to understand the microscopic origin of electron scattering in this system.

In this section, we combine high-resolution STM topography, defect-specific spectroscopy, and statistical analysis to build a comprehensive picture of the defect landscape in PtSn\textsubscript{4}. Topographic imaging allows us to classify defects by lattice site and local symmetry. Spectroscopy provides insight into how different defects perturb the local density of states, distinguishing weak perturbations at Pt sites from slight stronger modifications at Sn sites. Finally, a statistical framework enables quantitative estimates of defect densities and their correlation with transport properties across samples of different crystalline quality. Together, these complementary approaches clarify the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to scattering and establish the role of defects in governing the exceptional residual resistivity ratio of PtSn\textsubscript{4}.

All measurements were conducted at 4.4 K.}
	\label{fig:ch4_defectgallery}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Defects Topography}
Throughout the exploration on both fast-cooled and slow-cooled samples, different types of defects are observed, with the dominant type being point defects. In total, we observed 9 types of point defects in PtSn$_4$ as shown in Figure. \ref{fig:ch4_defectgallery}. 6 types are characterized as residing on Pt-sites and 3 on the Sn-site. Whether the defect belongs to a Sn-site or a Pt-site is determined by the lattice symmetry of the Pt-layer and Sn-layer. As shown in Figure. \ref{fig:ch4_symmetry}, point defects sitting at the Pt-site will break the local translational symmetry, changing the local electronic environment of 4 neighboring Pt atoms and thus exhibits a 2 fold symmetry and mirror symmetry in 2 axes(C$_2v$). As for Sn-layers, a modification on the Sn-site will result in a pattern with lower symmetry, with mirror symmetry in only 1 axis. Therefore, we can determine the what plane a defect lies in, based on the symmetry exhibited by the defect topography. 

\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:ch4_symmetry}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Defect Spectroscopy}\label{section:defect_spectro}
To investigate the local electronic response of individual defects in PtSn\textsubscript{4}, we performed spatially resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) across six distinct defect types observed in both slow- and fast-cooled samples. Figure \ref{fig:defect_spectro} summarizes the results, combining structural topographies, defect-centered spectra, and reference pristine spectra.

The top row of Fig. \ref{fig:defect_spectro} (panels a–d) presents representative STM topographies of three Sn-site (Sn1, Sn2, Sn3) and three Pt-site (Pt1, Pt2, Pt3) defects. The second row (panels e–h) shows $dI/dV$ spectra acquired directly on defect centers and in their vicinity, together with a pristine reference spectrum extracted from the grid maps from the same region. Because of the sparse distribution of defects in PtSn\textsubscript{4}, no single field of view contained all defect types; instead, four independent grids were used. To account for variations in junction conditions between grids, pristine reference spectra were averaged from the black shaded regions from the corresponding grid map, and plotted in black; they serve as the baseline for comparison. Three recurring spectral features near the Fermi level are highlighted by vertical gray markers: a shoulder feature at $\sim$250 meV , followed by a steep rise, and two dominant peaks at $\sim$300 meV and $\sim$450 meV.

Spectroscopic signatures at Pt-site defects show only modest deviations from the pristine response. As illustrated in panels e) and f), all three characteristic spectral features remain visible, and their relative energies are unchanged. The most notable effect is a suppression of the overall spectral weight, typically in the range of 10–25\% compared to pristine regions. This indicates that Pt-site defects perturb the local density of states (LDOS) only weakly, acting potentially only as minor scattering centers.

By contrast, Sn-site defects produce far more substantial modifications of the LDOS. For the Sn1 defect, the low-energy shoulder shifts toward lower bias by approximately 50 meV, and the $\sim$300 meV peak is strongly suppressed or absent altogether. The higher-energy $\sim$450 meV peak persists but with an overall reduction in intensity of about 50\%. The Sn2 defect exhibits an even more striking spatial variation: spectra taken directly at the defect center show an $\sim$80\% suppression of the intensity peak, while spectra taken at the lobes surrounding the defect closely resemble the pristine surface. For the Sn3 defect, the shoulder region is enhanced, the $\sim$300 meV peak remains nearly unchanged, and the $\sim$450 meV peak is absent. These diverse responses among Sn-site defects highlight their ability to reshape the local electronic environment in distinct ways.

In summary, the spectroscopy reveals two main effects. First, no distinct defect-bound states are detected within the stable energy window; instead, defect-centered spectra largely preserve the pristine LDOS features, with modifications limited to overall intensity. Second, Sn-site and Pt-site defects exhibit different degrees of LDOS modulation: Pt-site defects cause only mild suppression of spectral weight, while Sn-site defects shift or suppress characteristic features and display strong spatial variation. The stronger LDOS modifications from Sn-site defects suggest they may represent the dominant source of electron scattering when present.

However, as noted in Appendix \ref{appen:non-intrinsic}, certain Sn-site features—such as the Sn1 defect—may have non-intrinsic origins. This distinction underscores the importance of considering both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions when interpreting defect statistics.

\subsection{Defect Statistics}

\subsubsection{Statistical Framework}
Defect density provides a direct measure of the lattice perfection of a system. As expressed in Equation \ref{eq:scattering_rate_single_defect}, defect density contributes directly to macroscopic transport and must therefore be carefully evaluated in order to understand the exotic transport properties of PtSn\textsubscript{4}, particularly its low residual resistivity. To obtain reliable estimates of defect densities and their associated uncertainties, we employed a statistical framework based on binomial and Poisson distributions and justified its applicability to our experimental observations.
\par Our analysis of defect densities in PtSn\textsubscript{4} crystals commences with the consensus that that point defects emerge as a stochastic process\cite{rudolphDefectFormationCrystal2010,mosquera-loisImperfectionsAreNot2023}. Given the crystal lattice structure, defects can randomly occur at any site, rendering each occurrence an independent event. This randomness and independence are fundamental assumptions that underpin our methodological approach, we will evaluate them in the later paragraph.  
\par In total, 3 types of Sn-site defects and 6 kinds of Pt defects are observed. Since each site can only be occupied by one point defect, we can conceptualize each lattice site as a discrete trial within a binomial framework. A 'success' in this context was defined as the presence of this particular type of point defect at a given site, denoted by "1", while its absence was considered a "reference event", denoted by "0". This binary scheme facilitated the application of the binomial distribution to model the statistics of defect occurrences across the lattice.
\par Given the extensive scanning area corresponding to a vast number of lattice sites (trial), coupled with the markedly low probability of defect occurrence (success rate), our analysis necessitated an approximation to simplify computations and enhance analytical tractability. The 
binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distribution under these conditions of large trial numbers and a small success rate. This approximation is underpinned by established statistical criteria. When the number of trials (n) exceeds 100 and the success rate (p) is below 0.1, the Poisson distribution serves as an effective surrogate for the binomial distribution. 
\par In our specific case, with n on the order of $10^5$ and p ranging between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-5}$, the mean of the Poisson distribution ($\lambda=n\cdot p$) falls between 1 and 100. These conditions justify the transition from a binomial to a Poisson framework, as the latter is well suited for describing rare events in large populations. Beyond simplifying the mathematical treatment, the Poisson approximation offers computational efficiency and enhances the interpretability of defect statistics in PtSn\textsubscript{4}.
\par The sparse and non-clustered distribution of defects, as revealed through Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) topographies, provides empirical validation for these assumptions. The lack of defect clustering supports the treatment of defect occurrences as independent events, likely driven by thermal activation rather than mechanical strain, since the latter would be expected to produce clustering or patterned distributions through stress-relaxation dynamics in the crystal lattice.

This statistical framework is essential for two reasons. First, by converting each two-dimensional STM scan into a sequence of discrete defect events, it allows scans from different regions, imaging conditions, and even samples to be aggregated into one large dataset. This aggregation increases the effective sampling area and ensures that defect densities are evaluated on a statistically meaningful scale, rather than being limited by the size of individual scans. Second, the framework provides a rigorous means to quantify the uncertainties associated with defect densities. Previous STM studies have often reported defect counts without a systematic treatment of statistical error, leaving the robustness of their estimates unclear\cite{daiIntrinsicLimitTopological2016,alpichshevSTMImagingImpurity2012,mcelroyAtomicScaleSourcesMechanism2005}. By contrast, our approach incorporates well-defined confidence intervals derived from binomial and Poisson statistics, enabling a more reliable connection between the microscopic distribution of defects and the macroscopic transport properties of PtSn\textsubscript{4}.

\subsubsection{Defect counting}
Defect counting is one of the key components to this study. Before the labour of manually counting the defects, it is important to sample our image pool to avoid bias and enhance statistical representativeness. There are a few principles I followed with image selection: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Use images with good and consistent tip conditions} — defined here as the ability to resolve atomic lattices. Consistency in tip quality ensures that defect patterns are reliably captured, making defect counting more robust.	
	\item \textbf{Avoid repetitive areas} — since many images are taken on the same location to check tip condition, including them would overweight particular regions and bias the statistics.
	\item \textbf{Select large-area images} — in this study, images larger than 50nm by 50nm were used, as smaller scans typically target specific features of interest and therefore introduce sampling bias. 
\end{itemize}  
To give the reader a sense of scale, we initially collected about 20,000 topographic images. Applying the first standard reduced this number to roughly 3,000, and the second eliminated about 80\% of those due to redundancy. With the third standard, we were left with 55 images in total—33 from sample S1 and 22 from sample S2. Despite this substantial reduction, the statistical framework established in the previous section ensures that the total area sampled is still sufficient to support statistically meaningful conclusions about defect density.

\par Defect densities for each type are reported in Table~\ref{tab:table1}. defect densities are reported on both the highRRR and lowRRR sample. Pt site defects are significantly rarer than Sn site defects, as discussed below. Of the 6 types of Pt-site defects, Pt$_{1}$,Pt$_{2}$ and Pt$_{3}$ were observed in both samples. All Pt site defects are in the range of 10--50 ppm, and of the three types present in both high and lower RRR samples, all increase in the fast-cooled lower RRR sample. The overall density of Pt site defects increases for the lower RRR sample, consistent with expectations from the increased low-temperature resistivity originating from point defect scatterers.

\par Defects residing on the Sn site are more prevalent in both samples, having densities that are between one and two orders of magnitude larger than the Pt site defects. However, the analysis is confounded by sensitivity to surface effects. Although significant increases in defects over time due to the adsorption of contaminants were not observed, other extrinsic variability appears to significantly influence the total Sn site defect density. In particular, the Sn$_1$ (croissant) defect is readily induced by the tip through voltage pulses or prolonged high voltage, and these defects have been observed to move and even annihilate, leading us to suspect these defects correspond to a Frenkel pair (a Sn adatom-Sn vacancy pair). The Sn$_2$ and Sn$_3$ defects anomalously decrease in S2 , contrary to expectations from the transport measurements. We suspect these correspond to vacancies and/or adatoms that arise during cleaving, as the Sn surface is easily disturbed. To test this hypothesis, one would have to examine the defect densities in samples from different cleaves, which are not done in this study. With these extrinsic factors in mind contributing to the total observed defect density, we can only place an upper limit on the number of scattering sites. While intrinsic Sn site defects are surely present, they are dominated by extrinsic ones, we will therefore focus more on the Pt site defects.

\par Having established that the Pt site defects provide a more reliable indicator of the intrinsic defect concentration, we can next examine the differences between sample S1 and S2. Pt$_1$, as the dominant intrinsic defect, doubled in S2, and the Pt$_2$ defect also has a sizable increase in the S2. And Pt$_3$ does not have a notable change in the density. Taken in aggregate the increase in defects corresponds to a $1.5\times$ larger concentration of Pt site defects in S2 with a lower \ac{RRR} as compared to S1 with a higher \ac{RRR}.  The increase in intrinsic defect densities is aligned with the increase in the low-temperature resistivity across the two samples. 
%todo: Need revisit. after analysis of QPI in PtSn4 for different defects, I can maybe then claim the scattering rate of different defects differ little, and thus, we can correlate e-i scattering directly to defect density.
Note that electron-impurity scattering is contributed by both the density of different types of defects and their scattering strength, however, as shown by the \ac{QPI} analysis in Ch.6, the scattering strength of different defect types differ little, we could expect a linear correlation between defect concentration and residual resistivity due to electron-defect scattering. The observed increase of $1.5$ times in the Pt site defects described here fails to account for the $5\times$ decrease in the \ac{RRR} value for S2 as compared to S1. We therefore conclude that, although the Sn site defects are dramatically obscured by the non-intrinsic effects described above, they must account for the majority of increased scattering centers. 


\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we established a statistical framework to quantify defect populations in PtSn\textsubscript{4} using multinomial statistics on STM topographies. By distinguishing between Pt- and Sn-site defects and systematically comparing multiple samples under different growth conditions, we found that the defect densities are exceptionally low—even under rapid cooling. This places PtSn\textsubscript{4} among the most defect-free semimetals studied to date.

The implications of such dilute defect populations are twofold. On a methodological level, the ability to resolve defect-specific densities provides a microscopic metric for benchmarking crystal quality. On a physical level, the scarcity of scattering centers naturally accounts for the vanishing residual resistivity and exceptionally high residual resistivity ratio (RRR) reported in transport studies. This interpretation points to crystalline perfection, rather than exotic topological suppression of scattering, as the origin of the high mobility; in line with the semi-classical transport models established to address the origin of the extreme magnetoresistance in PtSn\textsubscript{4}\cite{diazSemiclassicalOriginExtreme2024}. To conclude, the statistical analysis of defect-specific populations not only underscores the intrinsic quality of PtSn\textsubscript{4}, but also reframes its remarkable transport properties in terms of lattice perfection, with topological effects playing at most a secondary role.
