	abstract = {Understanding {AI} systems’ inner workings is critical for ensuring value alignment and safety. This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding. We establish foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. We survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to {AI} safety. We examine benefits in understanding, control, alignment, and risks such as capability gains and dual-use concerns. We investigate challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation. We advocate for clarifying concepts, setting standards, and scaling techniques to handle complex models and behaviors and expand to domains such as vision and reinforcement learning. Mechanistic interpretability could help prevent catastrophic outcomes as {AI} systems become more powerful and inscrutable.

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, deﬁned as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world {AI} systems. We present a list of ﬁve practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side eﬀects” and “avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration” and “distributional shift”). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge {AI} systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of {AI}.},

	abstract = {The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, {AI} companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of {AI} risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an {AI} Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of {AI} risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of {AI} risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of {AI} Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, {AI}; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of {AI} Risks classifies risks into seven {AI} risk domains: (1) Discrimination \& toxicity, (2) Privacy \& security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors \& misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic \& environmental, and (7) {AI} system safety, failures, \& limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The {AI} Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract {AI} risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by {AI} systems.},

            The functionalities of materials are governed by the atom type and arrangement, and perturbations caused by defects and adsorbate interactions often significantly alter the behavior of materials. Scanning probe microscopy ({SPM}) can capture complex interactions caused by the structures on surfaces. It is, however, difficult to analyze such interactions appearing there. In this paper, an image-processing technique that employs template matching to recognize local structures in {SPM} images and calculate positional correlations is reported. This approach opens new avenues for investigating intricate perturbations in the sciences and provides detailed insights into materials science.},

            Modern high-resolution microscopes are commonly used to study specimens that have dense and aperiodic spatial structure. Extracting meaningful information from images obtained from such microscopes remains a formidable challenge. Fourier analysis is commonly used to analyze the structure of such images. However, the Fourier transform fundamentally suffers from severe phase noise when applied to aperiodic images. Here, we report the development of an algorithm based on nonconvex optimization that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space image. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier analysis, we show that this algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive information about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide superconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the complete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material.},

This problem is ill-posed without further constraints or priors. This paper studies the situation where the nonzero entries in the activation signal are sparsely and randomly populated. We normalize the convolution kernel to have unit Frobenius norm and cast the sparse blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. With this spherical constraint, every spurious local minimum turns out to be close to some signed shift truncation of the ground truth, under certain hypotheses. This benign property motivates an eﬀective two stage algorithm that recovers the ground truth from the partial information oﬀered by a suboptimal local minimum. This geometry-inspired algorithm recovers the ground truth for certain microscopy problems, also exhibits promising performance in the more challenging image deblurring problem. Our insights into the global geometry and the two stage algorithm extend to the convolutional dictionary learning problem, where a superposition of multiple convolution signals is observed.},

Although some transport properties are subject to spin-orbit scattering, experimental techniques directly accessible to this eﬀect are limited. Here we show that a signature of spin-orbit scattering manifests itself in quasiparticle interference ({QPI}) imaged by spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. The experimental data of a polar semiconductor {BiTeI} are well reproduced by numerical simulations with the T -matrix formalism that include not only scalar scattering normally adopted but also spin-orbit scattering stronger than scalar scattering. To accelerate the simulations, we extend the standard eﬃcient method of {QPI} calculation for momentum-independent scattering to be applicable even for spin-orbit scattering. We further identify a selection rule that makes spin-orbit scattering visible in the {QPI} pattern. These results demonstrate that spin-orbit scattering can exert predominant inﬂuence on {QPI} patterns and thus suggest that {QPI} measurement is available to detect spin-orbit scattering.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial intelligence ({AI}) researchers have been developing and reﬁning large language models ({LLMs}) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by {OpenAI}, {GPT}-4 [Ope23], was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of {GPT}-4, when it was still in active development by {OpenAI}. We contend that (this early version of) {GPT}4 is part of a new cohort of {LLMs} (along with {ChatGPT} and Google’s {PaLM} for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous {AI} models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, {GPT}-4 can solve novel and diﬃcult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, {GPT}-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as {ChatGPT}. Given the breadth and depth of {GPT}-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artiﬁcial general intelligence ({AGI}) system. In our exploration of {GPT}-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of {AGI}, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reﬂections on societal inﬂuences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

              Foundation models (e.g., {GPT}-4 and Llama 3.1) are at the epicenter of artificial intelligence ({AI}), driving technological innovation and billions of dollars in investment. This has sparked widespread demands for regulation. Central to the debate about how to regulate foundation models is the process by which foundation models are released (

              )—whether they are made available only to the model developers, fully open to the public, or somewhere in between. Open foundation models can benefit society by promoting competition, accelerating innovation, and distributing power. However, an emerging concern is whether open foundation models pose distinct risks to society (

              ). In general, although most policy proposals and regulations do not mention open foundation models by name, they may have an uneven impact on open and closed foundation models. We illustrate tensions that surface—and that policy-makers should consider—regarding different policy proposals that may disproportionately damage the innovation ecosystem around open foundation models.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is progressing rapidly, and companies are shifting their focus to developing generalist {AI} systems that can autonomously act and pursue goals. Increases in capabilities and autonomy may soon massively amplify {AI}’s impact, with risks that include large-scale social harms, malicious uses, and an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous {AI} systems. Although researchers have warned of extreme risks from {AI}1, there is a lack of consensus about how exactly such risk arise, and how to manage them. Society’s response, despite promising first steps, is incommensurate with the possibility of rapid, transformative progress that is expected by many experts. {AI} safety research is lagging. Present governance initiatives lack the mechanisms and institutions to prevent misuse and recklessness, and barely address autonomous systems. In this short consensus paper, we describe extreme risks from upcoming, advanced {AI} systems. Drawing on lessons learned from other safety-critical technologies, we then outline a comprehensive plan combining technical research and development (R\&D) with proactive, adaptive governance mechanisms for a more commensurate preparation.},

	abstract = {Recent decisions by leading {AI} labs to either open-source their models or to restrict access to their models has sparked debate about whether, and how, increasingly capable {AI} models should be shared. Open-sourcing in {AI} typically refers to making model architecture and weights freely and publicly accessible for anyone to modify, study, build on, and use. This offers advantages such as enabling external oversight, accelerating progress, and decentralizing control over {AI} development and use. However, it also presents a growing potential for misuse and unintended consequences. This paper offers an examination of the risks and beneﬁts of open-sourcing highly capable foundation models. While open-sourcing has historically provided substantial net beneﬁts for most software and {AI} development processes, we argue that for some highly capable foundation models likely to be developed in the near future, open-sourcing may pose sufﬁciently extreme risks to outweigh the beneﬁts. In such a case, highly capable foundation models should not be open-sourced, at least not initially. Alternative strategies, including non-open-source model sharing options, are explored. The paper concludes with recommendations for developers, standard-setting bodies, and governments for establishing safe and responsible model sharing practices and preserving open-source beneﬁts where safe.},

Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.},

              The search for topological superconductivity ({TSC}) is currently an exciting pursuit, since non-trivial topological superconducting phases could host exotic Majorana modes. However, the difficulty in fabricating proximity-induced {TSC} heterostructures, the sensitivity to disorder and stringent topological restrictions of intrinsic {TSC} place serious limitations and formidable challenges on the materials and related applications. Here, we report a new type of intrinsic {TSC}, namely intrinsic surface topological superconductivity ({IS}-{TSC}) and demonstrate it in layered {AuSn}

              of 2.4 K. Different in-plane and out-of-plane upper critical fields reflect a two-dimensional (2D) character of superconductivity. The two-fold symmetric angular dependences of both magneto-transport and the zero-bias conductance peak ({ZBCP}) in point-contact spectroscopy ({PCS}) in the superconducting regime indicate an unconventional pairing symmetry of {AuSn}

              The search for topological superconductivity ({TSC}) is currently an exciting pursuit, since non-trivial topological superconducting phases could host exotic Majorana modes. However, the difficulty in fabricating proximity-induced {TSC} heterostructures, the sensitivity to disorder and stringent topological restrictions of intrinsic {TSC} place serious limitations and formidable challenges on the materials and related applications. Here, we report a new type of intrinsic {TSC}, namely intrinsic surface topological superconductivity ({IS}-{TSC}) and demonstrate it in layered {AuSn}

	abstract = {Topological superconductivity ({TSC}) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode ({MZM}) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy {AuSn}4 has been identified as an intrinsic surface {TSC}. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and {MZM} remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of {AuSn}4, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an {MZM} in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and {MZM} in superconductors.},

              Despite their highly anisotropic complex-oxidic nature, certain delafossite compounds (
              e.g
              ., {PdCoO}

              , {PtCoO}
              2
              ) are the most conductive oxides known, for reasons that remain poorly understood. Their room-temperature conductivity can exceed that of Au, while their low-temperature electronic mean-free-paths reach an astonishing 20 μm. It is widely accepted that these materials must be ultrapure to achieve this, although the methods for their growth (which produce only small crystals) are not typically capable of such. Here, we report a different approach to {PdCoO}
              2
              crystal growth, using chemical vapor transport methods to achieve order-of-magnitude gains in size, the highest structural qualities yet reported, and record residual resistivity ratios ( {\textgreater} 440). Nevertheless, detailed mass spectrometry measurements on these materials reveal that they are not ultrapure in a general sense, typically harboring 100s-of-parts-per-million impurity levels. Through quantitative crystal-chemical analyses, we resolve this apparent dichotomy, showing that the vast majority of impurities are forced to reside in the Co-O octahedral layers, leaving the conductive Pd sheets highly pure (∼1 ppm impurity concentrations). These purities are shown to be in quantitative agreement with measured residual resistivities. We thus conclude that a sublattice purification mechanism is essential to the ultrahigh low-temperature conductivity and mean-free-path of metallic delafossites.},

              The search for topological superconductivity ({TSC}) is currently an exciting pursuit, since non-trivial topological superconducting phases could host exotic Majorana modes. However, the difficulty in fabricating proximity-induced {TSC} heterostructures, the sensitivity to disorder and stringent topological restrictions of intrinsic {TSC} place serious limitations and formidable challenges on the materials and related applications. Here, we report a new type of intrinsic {TSC}, namely intrinsic surface topological superconductivity ({IS}-{TSC}) and demonstrate it in layered {AuSn}
              4
              with
              T
              
                c
              
              of 2.4 K. Different in-plane and out-of-plane upper critical fields reflect a two-dimensional (2D) character of superconductivity. The two-fold symmetric angular dependences of both magneto-transport and the zero-bias conductance peak ({ZBCP}) in point-contact spectroscopy ({PCS}) in the superconducting regime indicate an unconventional pairing symmetry of {AuSn}
              4
              . The superconducting gap and surface multi-bands with Rashba splitting at the Fermi level (
              E
              
                F
              
              ), in conjunction with first-principle calculations, strongly suggest that 2D unconventional {SC} in {AuSn}
              4
              originates from the mixture of
              p-
              wave surface and
              s-
              wave bulk contributions, which leads to a two-fold symmetric superconductivity. Our results provide an exciting paradigm to realize {TSC}
              via

It is suggested that the observed quadratic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at low temperatures in zero field can be due to, in addition to electron-electron scattering, the “electron-phonon-surface” interference scattering mechanism. The transition from high effective magnetic fields to weak ones, which is observed in compensated conductors with a closed Fermi surface, was proposed as a possible explanation for the minimum on the temperature dependence of the resistivity of {PtSn}4 and {WTe}2 in a magnetic field. The values of the mean free path of current carriers were estimated in these materials.},

In particular, we consider the models introduced in Phys. Rev. B 93, 041109(R) (A) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 076801 (B), and we find that, as opposed to observations previously obtained via joint density of states and spin-dependent scattering probability, the inter-arc scattering in the quasiparticle interference features is fully suppressed in model A, and very small in model B. Our findings indicate that these models may not correctly describe materials such as {MoTe}2, since for such materials inter-arc scattering is clearly visible experimentally, e.g., in Nature Phys. 12, 1105-1110 (2016). We also focus on the minimal models proposed by {McCormick} et al. in Phys. Rev. B 95, 075133, which indeed recover significant inter-arc scattering features.},

Our results reveal a kink in the otherwise parabolic band dispersion of the surface electrons and an increase in the quasiparticle lifetime near the Fermi energy 𝐸𝑓. The experimental data are accurately modeled with the 𝑇-matrix formalism for scattering from a single impurity, assuming that the surface electrons are dressed by the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. We confirm the latter as the interaction responsible for the deviations from bare dispersion. We further show how {FT}-{STS} can be used to simultaneously extract real and imaginary parts of the self-energy for both occupied and unoccupied states with a momentum and energy resolution competitive with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. From our quantitative analysis of the data we extract a Debye energy of ℏ⁢𝛺𝐷 =14 ±1 {meV} and an electron-phonon coupling strength of 𝜆 =0.13 ±0.02, consistent with previous results.

	abstract = {Exotic electronic states are realized in novel quantum materials. This field is revolutionized by the topological classification of materials. Such compounds necessarily host unique states on their boundaries. Scanning tunneling microscopy studies of these surface states have provided a wealth of spectroscopic characterization, with the successful cooperation of ab initio calculations. The method of quasiparticle interference imaging proves to be particularly useful for probing the dispersion relation of the surface bands. Herein, how a variety of additional fundamental electronic properties can be probed via this method is reviewed. It is demonstrated how quasiparticle interference measurements entail mesoscopic size quantization and the electronic phase coherence in semiconducting nanowires; helical spin protection and energy-momentum fluctuations in a topological insulator; and the structure of the Bloch wave function and the relative insusceptibility of topological electronic states to surface potential in a topological Weyl semimetal.},

	abstract = {The transient processes of phonon scattering and transmission in Si phononic crystals (periodic pore structures) are simulated using the concurrent atomistic-continuum method. The nature of phonon transport is demonstrated to be strongly dependent on the relation between the phonon wavelength, λ, and the period length, p, and the neck width, n, of the phononic crystal. Three distinct regimes have been observed: (1) phonons with wavelengths equal to 2.9p or larger propagate predominantly ballistically, which is accompanied by specular reflection of varying extents, depending on the wavelength of the phonons; the properties of these phonons are consistent with the phonon dispersion relations of a homogenous and harmonic system; (2) phonons with wavelengths {\textless}n are partly reflected by the pore boundaries and partly propagate ballistically in the solid regions of the necks; two types of vibrational modes are identified: the single crystal Si phonon modes, and the vibrational modes resulting from internal surface scattering; (3) phonons with wavelength close to p are most strongly scattered, and the internal surface-related modes dominate the transport; these modes have the slowest group velocities and lowest energy transmission, and the transport is predominantly diffusive even for specimens originally at zero temperature. For phononic crystals that contain a single crystal heater at their center, the interface between the single crystal and the phononic structure provides a strong resistance to short wavelength phonons, leading to predominantly diffusive phonon transport and an average energy flux that is two orders of magnitude lower than a same-sized single crystal specimen.},

Yet, being a surface-sensitive technique, the interpretation of {QPI} only works well for anisotropic materials, where the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the surface can be neglected and the quasiparticle interference is dominated by a quasi-2D electronic structure. Here, we explore {QPI} imaging of galena, a material with an electronic structure that does not exhibit pronounced anisotropy. We find that the quasiparticle interference signal is dominated by scattering vectors which are parallel to the surface plane however originate from bias-dependent cuts of the 3D electronic structure. We develop a formalism for the theoretical description of the {QPI} signal and demonstrate how this quasiparticle tomography can be used to obtain information about the 3D electronic structure and orbital character of the bands.},

	abstract = {Sparse word embeddings models ({SPINE}, {SINr}) are designed to embed words in interpretable dimensions. An interpretable dimension is such that a human can interpret the semantic (or syntactic) relations between words active for a dimension. These models are useful for critical downstream tasks in natural language processing (e.g. medical or legal {NLP}), and digital humanities applications. This work extends interpretability at the vector level with a more manageable number of activated dimensions following recommendations from psycholinguistics. Subsequently, one of the key criteria to an interpretable model is sparsity: in order to be interpretable, not every word should be represented by all the features of the model, especially if humans have to interpret these features and their relations. This raises one question: to which extent is sparsity sustainable with regard to performance? We thus introduce a sparsification procedure to evaluate its impact on two interpretable methods ({SPINE} and {SINr}) to tend towards sustainable vector interpretability. We also introduce stability as a new criterion to interpretability. Our stability evaluations show little albeit non-zero variation for {SPINE} and {SINr} embeddings. We then show that increasing sparsity does not necessarily interfere with performance. These results are encouraging and pave the way towards intrinsically interpretable word vectors.},

            This book is an introduction to the techniques of many-body quantum theory with a large number of applications to condensed matter physics. The basic idea of the book is to provide a self-contained formulation of the theoretical framework without losing mathematical rigor, while at the same time providing physical motivation and examples. The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given.

	abstract = {Quasiparticles are a powerful concept of condensed matter quantum theory. In this review, the appearence and the properties of quasiparticles are presented in a unifying perspective. The principles behind the existence of quasiparticle excitations in both quantum disordered and ordered phases of fermionic and bosonic systems are discussed. The lifetime of quasiparticles is considered in particular near a continuous classical or quantum phase transition, when the nature of quasiparticles on both sides of a transition into an ordered state changes. A new concept of critical quasiparticles near a quantum critical point is introduced, and applied to quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion metals. Fractional quasiparticles in systems of restricted dimensionality are reviewed. Dirac quasiparticles emerging in so-called Dirac materials are discussed. The more recent discoveries of topologically protected chiral quasiparticles in topological matter and Majorana quasiparticles in topological superconductors are briefly reviewed.},
