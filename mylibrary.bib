  abstract = {Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side effects” and “avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration” and “distributional shift”). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

State-of-the-art Raman microscopes, based on point-scanning frequency-domain detection, have long (∼1s) pixel dwell times, making it challenging to acquire images of a significant area (e.g.,\&\#x00A0;100×100µm). Here we present a compact wide-field Raman microscope based on a time-domain Fourier-transform approach, which enables parallel acquisition of the Raman spectra on all pixels of a 2D detector. A common-path birefringent interferometer with exceptional delay stability and reproducibility can rapidly acquire Raman maps (∼30m i n for a 250000p i x e l image) with high spatial (\&lt;1µm) and spectral (∼23c m −1) resolutions. Time-domain detection allows us to disentangle fluorescence and Raman signals, which can both be measured separately. We validate the system by Raman imaging plastic microbeads and demonstrate its multimodal operation by capturing fluorescence and Raman maps of a multilayer-W S e 2 sample, providing complementary information on the strain and number of layers of the material.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

Such compounds necessarily host unique states on their boundaries. Scanning tunneling microscopy studies of these surface states have provided a wealth of spectroscopic characterization, with the successful cooperation of ab initio calculations. The method of quasiparticle interference imaging proves to be particularly useful for probing the dispersion relation of the surface bands. Herein, how a variety of additional fundamental electronic properties can be probed via this method is reviewed. It is demonstrated how quasiparticle interference measurements entail mesoscopic size quantization and the electronic phase coherence in semiconducting nanowires; helical spin protection and energy-momentum fluctuations in a topological insulator; and the structure of the Bloch wave function and the relative insusceptibility of topological electronic states to surface potential in a topological Weyl semimetal.},

  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇 =0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

  abstract = {Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems1. Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.},

Increases in capabilities and autonomy may soon massively amplify AI’s impact, with risks that include large-scale social harms, malicious uses, and an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous AI systems. Although researchers have warned of extreme risks from AI1, there is a lack of consensus about how exactly such risk arise, and how to manage them. Society’s response, despite promising first steps, is incommensurate with the possibility of rapid, transformative progress that is expected by many experts. AI safety research is lagging. Present governance initiatives lack the mechanisms and institutions to prevent misuse and recklessness, and barely address autonomous systems. In this short consensus paper, we describe extreme risks from upcoming, advanced AI systems. Drawing on lessons learned from other safety-critical technologies, we then outline a comprehensive plan combining technical research and development (R\&D) with proactive, adaptive governance mechanisms for a more commensurate preparation.},

This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding. We establish foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. We survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety. We examine benefits in understanding, control, alignment, and risks such as capability gains and dual-use concerns. We investigate challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation.

In particular, synthetic data are a promising concept toward solving the aporetic conflict between data privacy and data sharing. Yet, it is known that accurately generating private, synthetic data of certain kinds is NP-hard. We develop a statistical framework for differentially private synthetic data, which enables us to circumvent the computational hardness of the problem. We consider the true data as a random sample drawn from a population Ømega according to some unknown density. We then replace Ømega by a much smaller random subset Ømega \textsuperscript{\textbackslash ast} , which we sample according to some known density. We generate synthetic data on the reduced space Ømega \textsuperscript{\textbackslash ast} by fitting the specified linear statistics obtained from the true data. To ensure privacy we use the common Laplacian mechanism. Employing the concept of Rényi condition number, which measures how well the sampling distribution is correlated with the population distribution, we derive explicit bounds on the privacy and accuracy provided by the proposed method.},

  abstract = {A new approach to the treatment of the interactions in a collection of electrons is developed, which we call the collective description. The collective description is based on the organized behavior produced by the interactions in an electron gas of high density; this organized behavior results in oscillations of the system as a whole, the so-called "plasma oscillations." The collective description, in contrast to the usual individual particle description, describes in a natural way the long-range correlations in electron positions brought about by their mutual interaction. In this paper we confine our attention to the magnetic interactions between the electrons; the coulomb interactions will be discussed in a subsequent paper.},

This has sparked widespread demands for regulation. Central to the debate about how to regulate foundation models is the process by which foundation models are released (                                1                              )—whether they are made available only to the model developers, fully open to the public, or somewhere in between. Open foundation models can benefit society by promoting competition, accelerating innovation, and distributing power. However, an emerging concern is whether open foundation models pose distinct risks to society (                                2                              ).

  abstract = {Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the internal mechanisms learned by neural networks. Despite recent progress toward this goal, it remains unclear how best to decompose neural network parameters into mechanistic components. We introduce Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), a method that directly decomposes a neural network's parameters into components that (i) are faithful to the parameters of the original network, (ii) require a minimal number of components to process any input, and (iii) are maximally simple. Our approach thus optimizes for a minimal length description of the network's mechanisms. We demonstrate APD's effectiveness by successfully identifying ground truth mechanisms in multiple toy experimental settings: Recovering features from superposition; separating compressed computations; and identifying cross-layer distributed representations. While challenges remain to scaling APD to non-toy models, our results suggest solutions to several open problems in mechanistic interpretability, including identifying minimal circuits in superposition, offering a conceptual foundation for 'features', and providing an architecture-agnostic framework for neural network decomposition.},

The basic idea of the book is to provide a self-contained formulation of the theoretical framework without losing mathematical rigor, while at the same time providing physical motivation and examples. The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given. Having grown out of a set of lecture notes, and containing many pedagogical exercises, this book is designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course, and is also well suited for self-study.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 [Ope23], was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

We observe quasiparticle interference in the strongly Rashba split 2DEG-like surface band found at the tellurium termination of BiTeBr and examine two mechanisms governing quasiparticle scattering: We confirm the suppression of spin-flip scattering by comparing measured quasiparticle interference with a spin-dependent elastic scattering model applied to the calculated spectral function. We also use atomically resolved STM maps to identify point defect lattice sites and spectro-microscopy imaging to discern their varying scattering strengths, which we understand in terms of the calculated orbital characteristics of the surface band. Defects on the Bi sublattice cause the strongest scattering of the predominantly Bi 6p derived surface band, with other defects causing nearly no scattering near the conduction band minimum.}

We present Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning, a promising approach in AI Safety that could substantially improve our ability to build honest artificial intelligence. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on empathy, SOO aims to align how AI models represent themselves and others. Our experiments on LLMs with 7B, 27B, and 78B parameters demonstrate SOO's efficacy: deceptive responses of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 dropped from 73.6\% to 17.2\% with no observed reduction in general task performance, while in Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 deceptive responses were reduced from 100\% to 9.3\% and 2.7\%, respectively, with a small impact on capabilities. In reinforcement learning scenarios, SOO-trained agents showed significantly reduced deceptive behavior. SOO's focus on contrastive self and other-referencing observations offers strong potential for generalization across AI architectures. While current applications focus on language models and simple RL environments, SOO could pave the way for more trustworthy AI in broader domains. Ethical implications and long-term effects warrant further investigation, but SOO represents a significant step forward in AI safety research.},

In this work, we utilize low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT-STM/S) to elicit how distinct types of defects bring forth scattering potential engineering based on intervalley quantum quasiparticle interference (QPI) in TMDs. Furthermore, quantifying the energy-dependent phase variation of the QPI standing wave reveals the detailed electron–defect interaction between the substitution-induced scattering potential and the carrier transport mechanism. By exploring the intrinsic electronic behavior of atomic-level defects to further understand how defects affect carrier transport in low-dimensional semiconductors, we offer potential technological applications that may contribute to the future expansion of TMDs.},

Here, we report the development of an algorithm based on nonconvex optimization that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space image. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier analysis, we show that this algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive information about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide superconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the complete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material.},

  abstract = {Through considerable effort and intuition, several recent works have reverse-engineered nontrivial behaviors of transformer models. This paper systematizes the mechanistic interpretability process they followed. First, researchers choose a metric and dataset that elicit the desired model behavior. Then, they apply activation patching to find which abstract neural network units are involved in the behavior. By varying the dataset, metric, and units under investigation, researchers can understand the functionality of each component. We automate one of the process' steps: to identify the circuit that implements the specified behavior in the model's computational graph. We propose several algorithms and reproduce previous interpretability results to validate them. For example, the ACDC algorithm rediscovered 5/5 of the component types in a circuit in GPT-2 Small that computes the Greater-Than operation. ACDC selected 68 of the 32,000 edges in GPT-2 Small, all of which were manually found by previous work. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.},

  abstract = {One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is \textbackslash textit\{polysemanticity\}, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is \textbackslash textit\{superposition\}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task \textbackslash citep\{wang2022interpretability\} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability.},

Under this assumption, these works aimed to reconstruct feature directions using sparse coding. We develop metrics to assess the success of these sparse coding techniques and test the validity of the linearity and sparsity assumptions. We show our metrics can predict the level of sparsity on synthetic sparse linear activations, and can distinguish between sparse linear data and several other distributions. We use our metrics to measure levels of sparsity in several language models. We find evidence that language model activations can be accurately modelled by sparse linear combinations of features, significantly more so than control datasets. We also show that model activations appear to be sparsest in the first and final layers.},

We interpret such FT-STS measurements in terms of the quasiparticle interference (QPI), here investigating in detail the QPI due to single magnetic impurities adsorbed on a range of representative nonmagnetic host surfaces, and contrasting with the case of a simple scalar impurity or point defect. We demonstrate how the electronic correlations present for magnetic impurities markedly affect the QPI, showing, e.g., a large intensity enhancement due to the Kondo effect, and universality at low temperatures/scanning energies. The commonly used joint density of states interpretation of FT-STS measurements is also considered, and shown to be insufficient in many cases, including that of magnetic impurities.},

Concerning the defect chemistry, defect reactions and defect equilibrium including the construction of Kröger–Vink diagrams are presented.

In this paper, the applicability of the HiHTP algorithm for solving the bi-sparse blind deconvolution problem is studied. The bi-sparse blind deconvolution setting here consists of recovering \$h\$ and \$b\$ from the knowledge of \$h*(Qb)\$, where \$Q\$ is some linear operator, and both \$b\$ and \$h\$ are both assumed to be sparse. The approach rests upon lifting the problem to a linear one, and then applying HiHTP, through the \textbackslash emph\{hierarchical sparsity framework\}. \%In particular, the efficient HiHTP algorithm is proposed for performing the recovery.

  abstract = {Highly conductive topological semimetals with exotic electronic structures offer fertile ground for the investigation of the electrical and thermal transport behavior of quasiparticles. Here, we find that the layer-structured Dirac semimetal PtSn               4               exhibits a largely suppressed thermal conductivity under a magnetic field. At low temperatures, a dramatic decrease in the thermal conductivity of PtSn               4               by more than two orders of magnitude is obtained at 9\,T. Moreover, PtSn               4               shows both strong longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric responses under a magnetic field. Large power factor and Nernst power factor of approximately 80–100\,               μ               W·cm               -1               ·K               -2               are obtained around 15\,K in various magnetic fields.

This work provides a paradigm for the decoupling of the electron and hole transport behavior of highly conductive topological semimetals and is helpful for developing topological semimetals for thermoelectric energy conversion.},

We evaluate the accuracy of the WTBHs by comparing the Wannier band structures to directly calculated spin-orbit coupling DFT band structures. Our testing includes k-points outside the grid used in the Wannierization, providing an out-of-sample test of accuracy. We illustrate the use of WTBHs with a few example applications. We also develop a web-app that can be used to predict electronic properties on-the-fly using WTBH from our database.

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

Three other common defects, including one also on an Fe site, are observed to break local lattice symmetry and are pair breaking, indicated by clear in-gap bound states, in addition to states near the smaller gap edge. STS maps reveal complex, extended real-space bound-state patterns, including one with a chiral distribution of the local density of states.

Our results reveal a kink in the otherwise parabolic band dispersion of the surface electrons and an increase in the quasiparticle lifetime near the Fermi energy 𝐸𝑓. The experimental data are accurately modeled with the 𝑇-matrix formalism for scattering from a single impurity, assuming that the surface electrons are dressed by the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. We confirm the latter as the interaction responsible for the deviations from bare dispersion. We further show how FT-STS can be used to simultaneously extract real and imaginary parts of the self-energy for both occupied and unoccupied states with a momentum and energy resolution competitive with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. From our quantitative analysis of the data we extract a Debye energy of ℏ⁢𝛺𝐷 =14 ±1 meV and an electron-phonon coupling strength of 𝜆 =0.13 ±0.02, consistent with previous results. This proof-of-principle measurement advances FT-STS as a method for probing many body effects, which give rise to a rich array of material properties.},

  abstract = {Sparse word embeddings models (SPINE, SINr) are designed to embed words in interpretable dimensions. An interpretable dimension is such that a human can interpret the semantic (or syntactic) relations between words active for a dimension. These models are useful for critical downstream tasks in natural language processing (e.g. medical or legal NLP), and digital humanities applications. This work extends interpretability at the vector level with a more manageable number of activated dimensions following recommendations from psycholinguistics. Subsequently, one of the key criteria to an interpretable model is sparsity: in order to be interpretable, not every word should be represented by all the features of the model, especially if humans have to interpret these features and their relations. This raises one question: to which extent is sparsity sustainable with regard to performance? We thus introduce a sparsification procedure to evaluate its impact on two interpretable methods (SPINE and SINr) to tend towards sustainable vector interpretability. We also introduce stability as a new criterion to interpretability. Our stability evaluations show little albeit non-zero variation for SPINE and SINr embeddings. We then show that increasing sparsity does not necessarily interfere with performance. These results are encouraging and pave the way towards intrinsically interpretable word vectors.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies 𝐸⁡(k) and quasiparticle interactions 𝑓⁡(k, k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of 𝐸⁡(k). To estimate the derivative of 𝐸⁡(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for 𝑓. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

Not only are the linearly dispersing bands expected to give rise to exceptional electronic properties, but the weak screening of the Coulomb interaction near the line node may enhance electronic correlations, produce new many-body ground states, or influence the quasiparticle lifetime. We investigate the quasiparticle dynamics in the DLN material ZrSiS via spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). By studying the spatial decay of quasiparticle interference patterns (QPI) from point scatterers, we were able to directly and selectively extract the phase coherence length \$l\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}\$ and lifetime \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}\$ for the bulk DLN excitations, which are dominated by inelastic electron-electron scattering. We find that the experimental \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}(E)\$ values below \$-\$40 meV are very short, likely due to the stronger Coulomb interactions, and lie at the Planckian limit \$\textbackslash hbar/|E|\$.

Typical mechanisms for the emergence of nodal lines involve mirror symmetry and the               π               Berry phase. Here we show via               ab initio               calculations that fcc calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and ytterbium (Yb) have topological nodal lines with the               π               Berry phase near the Fermi level, when spin–orbit interaction is neglected. In particular, Ca becomes a nodal-line semimetal at high pressure. Owing to nodal lines, the Zak phase becomes either               π               or 0, depending on the wavevector               k               , and the               π               Zak phase leads to surface polarization charge. Carriers eventually screen it, leaving behind large surface dipoles. In materials with nodal lines, both the large surface polarization charge and the emergent drumhead surface states enhance Rashba splitting when heavy adatoms are present, as we have shown to occur in Bi/Sr(111) and in Bi/Ag(111).},

Our measurements reveal 10 different scattering wave vectors, which can be understood and precisely reproduced with a theory that takes into account the shape, spin texture, and momentum-dependent propagation of the Fermi arc surface states into the bulk. Our findings provide evidence that Weyl nodes act as sinks for electron transport on the surface of these materials.},

  abstract = {A difference Fourier map of the projected structure of bacteriorhodopsin has been synthesized from electron diffraction amplitudes collected from membranes prepared in the glucose-embedded state and the frozen-hydrated state. Phases of a recently published data set for glucose-embedded specimens [1] were used for the difference Fourier map. Moderate resolution (9 Å) and high resolution (4.25 Å) maps both indicate that glucose is exchangeable for water in the region of the map corresponding to the lipid regions. We interpret this as indicating that there is a small surface depression in this region of the structure. The depth of this feature is estimated to be 16 the thickness of the protein region in the membrane. The data obtained in this study rules out the existence of an aqueous transmembrane channel, the dimensions of which are large enough to allow free exchange of glucose for water. Several new features are also observed in the protein region of the membrane. These features are probably due to segments of the polypeptide at the aqueous interface that are well ordered in frozen-hydrated specimens but not in glucose-embedded specimens. Candidate structures for the origin of these features are extensions of the helices, or linker regions connecting the helices.},

The Fermi surfaces corresponding to the bands, which are responsible for non-trivial band topology along with the surface states are also mapped.

Despite their potential, their complex phase transitions arising from temperature-dependent phonon softening and anharmonic effects on dielectric properties remain poorly explored. In this study, we employ density-functional theory (DFT) and self-consistent phonon (SCP) calculations to investigate finite-temperature phonons in cubic niobate perovskites. To include explicit anharmonic vibrational effects, SCP frequencies are shifted by the bubble self-energy correction within the quasiparticle (QP) approximation, providing precise descriptions of phonon softening in these strongly anharmonic solids. We further calculate the static dielectric constant of KNbO3 and NaNbO3 as a function of temperature using the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation and QP-corrected phonon dispersions. Our theoretical results align with experimental data, offering reliable temperature-dependent phonon dispersions while considering anharmonic self-energies and thermal expansion effects, enhancing our understanding of the complex relations between lattice vibrations and phase transitions in these anharmonic oxides.},

We also revisit the Young fringe method in the light of the 3D Fourier transform, and have found a considerable amount of non-linear terms in Young fringes at 80kV even from a typical standard specimen, such as an amorphous Ge thin film.},

  abstract = {Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement. Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer 𝛼−RuCl3, the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations unique to 𝛼−RuCl3. Numerical simulations suggest that the observed oscillation can be reproduced by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects like Friedel oscillations in metals.},

Although some transport properties are subject to spin-orbit scattering, experimental techniques directly accessible to this effect are limited. Here we show that a signature of spin-orbit scattering manifests itself in quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaged by spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. The experimental data of a polar semiconductor BiTeI are well reproduced by numerical simulations with the T -matrix formalism that include not only scalar scattering normally adopted but also spin-orbit scattering stronger than scalar scattering. To accelerate the simulations, we extend the standard efficient method of QPI calculation for momentum-independent scattering to be applicable even for spin-orbit scattering. We further identify a selection rule that makes spin-orbit scattering visible in the QPI pattern. These results demonstrate that spin-orbit scattering can exert predominant influence on QPI patterns and thus suggest that QPI measurement is available to detect spin-orbit scattering.},

However, such measurements often yield noisy data. Machine learning provides techniques to reduce the noise in postprocessing, but traditionally requires noiseless examples which are unavailable for scientific experiments. In this work we adapt the unsupervised Noise2Noise and self-supervised Noise2Self algorithms, which allow for denoising without clean examples, to denoise quasiparticle interference data. We first apply the techniques on simulated data, and demonstrate that we are able to reduce the noise while preserving finer details, all while outperforming more traditional denoising techniques. We then apply the Noise2Self technique to experimental data from an overdoped cuprate [(Pb,Bi)2⁢Sr2⁢CuO6+𝛿] sample. Denoising enhances the clarity of quasiparticle interference patterns, and helps to obtain a precise extraction of electronic structure parameters. Self-supervised denoising is a promising tool for denoising quasiparticle interference data, facilitating deeper insights into the physics of complex materials.},

During transmission, each \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$ gets convolved with a function \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i\$. The receiver records the function \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{y\}\$, given by the sum of all these convolved signals. When and under which conditions is it possible to recover the individual signals \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$ and the blurring functions \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i\$ from just one received signal \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{y\}\$? This challenging problem, which intertwines blind deconvolution with blind demixing, appears in a variety of applications, such as audio processing, image processing, neuroscience, spectroscopy, and astronomy.

  abstract = {Suppose that we have \$r\$ sensors and each one intends to send a function \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$ (e.g.\textbackslash{} a signal or an image) to a receiver common to all \$r\$ sensors. During transmission, each \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$ gets convolved with a function \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i\$. The receiver records the function \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{y\}\$, given by the sum of all these convolved signals. When and under which conditions is it possible to recover the individual signals \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$ and the blurring functions \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i\$ from just one received signal \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{y\}\$? This challenging problem, which intertwines blind deconvolution with blind demixing, appears in a variety of applications, such as audio processing, image processing, neuroscience, spectroscopy, and astronomy. It is also expected to play a central role in connection with the future Internet-of-Things.

While convex optimization techniques are able to solve this joint blind deconvolution-demixing problem provably and robustly under certain conditions, for medium-size or large-size problems we need computationally faster methods without sacrificing the benefits of mathematical rigor that come with convex methods. In this paper, we present a non-convex algorithm which guarantees exact recovery under conditions that are competitive with convex optimization methods, with the additional advantage of being computationally much more efficient. Our two-step algorithm converges to the global minimum linearly and is also robust in the presence of additive noise. While the derived performance bounds are suboptimal in terms of the information-theoretic limit, numerical simulations show remarkable performance even if the number of measurements is close to the number of degrees of freedom. We discuss an application of the proposed framework in wireless communications in connection with the Internet-of-Things.},

Yet, being a surface-sensitive technique, the interpretation of QPI only works well for anisotropic materials, where the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the surface can be neglected and the quasiparticle interference is dominated by a quasi-2D electronic structure. Here, we explore QPI imaging of galena, a material with an electronic structure that does not exhibit pronounced anisotropy. We find that the quasiparticle interference signal is dominated by scattering vectors which are parallel to the surface plane however originate from bias-dependent cuts of the 3D electronic structure. We develop a formalism for the theoretical description of the QPI signal and demonstrate how this quasiparticle tomography can be used to obtain information about the 3D electronic structure and orbital character of the bands.},

Free exciton emission was clearly observed at low temperatures and dominated the PL spectrum above 100 K. Emission from 𝐴 excitons bound to three neutral donors dominated the low-temperature PL spectrum. Recombination of 𝐵 excitons bound to these same neutral donors were also identified along with 𝐴 excitons bound to the donors in their ionized state. A clear difference in the redshift of free and bound excitons with increasing temperature was observed and attributed to reduced exciton-phonon coupling for the bound excitons. Additionally, Fano resonance of the 1-LO replica of the dominant bound 𝐴 exciton was observed to reduce its PL intensity which can lead to the misidentification of the 2-LO replica as a donor-acceptor-pair transition.},

As-grown Bi2Te3 crystals contain vacancies, antisites, and interstitial defects that may result in bulk conductivity and therefore may change the insulating bulk character. Here, we demonstrate the interplay between the growth conditions and the density of different types of native near-surface defects. In particular, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the dependence on not only the local atomic environment but also on the growth kinetics and the resulting sample doping from n-type toward intrinsic crystals with the Fermi level positioned inside the energy gap. Our results establish a bias-dependent STM signature of the Bi2Te3 native defects and shed light on the link between the native defects and the electronic properties of Bi2Te3, which is relevant for the synthesis of topological insulator materials and the related functional properties.},

  abstract = {The limits of validity of the correlation-energy calculations in the regions of high density, low density, and actual metallic electron densities are discussed. Simple physical arguments are given which show that the high-density calculation of Gell-Mann and Brueckner is valid for 𝑟𝑠 ≲1 while the low-density calculation of Wigner is valid for 𝑟𝑠≳20. For actual metallic densities it is shown that the contribution to the correlation energy from long-wavelength momentum transfers (𝑘 {$<$}𝛽⁢𝑘0 {$<$}0.47⁢𝑟𝑠12⁢𝑘0) may be accurately calculated in the random phase approximation. This contribution is calculated using the Bohm-Pines extended Hamiltonian, and is shown to be 𝐸⁡(𝛽) =(−0.458⁢𝛽2𝑟𝑠+0.866⁢𝛽3𝑟𝑠32−0.98⁢𝛽4𝑟𝑠2)⁢(+0.019⁢𝛽4𝑟𝑠+0.706⁢𝛽5𝑟𝑠52+⋯)⁢ry. An identical result is obtained by a suitable expansion of the result of Gell-Mann and Brueckner; the validity of the Bohm-Pines neglect of subsidiary conditions in the calculation of the ground-state energy is thereby explicitly established. The contribution to the correlation energy from sufficiently high momentum transfers (𝑘≳𝑘0) will arise only from the interaction between electrons of antiparallel spin, and may be estimated using second-order perturbation theory. The contribution arising from intermediate momentum transfers (0.47⁢𝑟𝑠12⁢𝑘0 ≲𝑘 ≲𝑘0) cannot be calculated analytically; the interpolation procedures for this domain proposed by Pines and Hubbard are shown to be nearly identical, and their accuracy is estimated as ∼15\%. The result for the over-all correlation energy using the interpolation procedure of Pines is 𝐸𝑐≅(−0.115 +0.031⁢ln⁡𝑟𝑠)⁢ry.},

In this work, we present preliminary and indirect evidence for a hypothesis that induction heads might constitute the mechanism for the majority of all "in-context learning" in large transformer models (i.e. decreasing loss at increasing token indices). We find that induction heads develop at precisely the same point as a sudden sharp increase in in-context learning ability, visible as a bump in the training loss. We present six complementary lines of evidence, arguing that induction heads may be the mechanistic source of general in-context learning in transformer models of any size. For small attention-only models, we present strong, causal evidence; for larger models with MLPs, we present correlational evidence.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.},

In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.},

  abstract = {Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior.

The transition from high effective magnetic fields to weak ones, which is observed in compensated conductors with a closed Fermi surface, was proposed as a possible explanation for the minimum on the temperature dependence of the resistivity of PtSn4 and WTe2 in a magnetic field.

Lett. 119, 076801 (B), and we find that, as opposed to observations previously obtained via joint density of states and spin-dependent scattering probability, the inter-arc scattering in the quasiparticle interference features is fully suppressed in model A, and very small in model B. Our findings indicate that these models may not correctly describe materials such as MoTe2, since for such materials inter-arc scattering is clearly visible experimentally, e.g., in Nature Phys. 12, 1105-1110 (2016). We also focus on the minimal models proposed by McCormick et al. in Phys. Rev. B 95, 075133, which indeed recover significant inter-arc scattering features.},

In this paper, Prof. Perrin gave a detailed account of his work upon the distribution in fluids of small particles, which show the Brownian movement, and the bearing of these results on the kinetic theory of matter. An interesting survey is first given of the historical development cf this subject. The English naturalist, Brown, directed attention in 1827 to the fact that small particles suspended in liquids were always in a state of rapid but irregular movement. Comparatively little notice was paid to this observation until 1889, when Gouy showed that the Brownian movement could not be ascribed to temperature differences,but was a persistent effect which was probably a necessary consequence of the kinetic theory of matter. Since that time a large amount of interesting work has been done, especially by Continental workers, to throw further light on the magnitude and nature of the Brownian movement.},

Herein, a Green function-based formalism is derived for the ab initio computation of Fourier-transformed QPI images. The efficiency of the new implementation is shown at the examples of QPI that forms around magnetic and nonmagnetic defects at the Bi2Te3 surface. This method allows a deepened understanding of the scattering properties of topologically protected electrons off defects and is a useful tool in the study of quantum materials in the future.},

The clarity of the STM images was found to be correlated to the optically measured cone angle of the STM tip, with larger cone angles consistently producing atomically resolved images. The custom etching procedure described allows one to create larger cone angles and consequently proved superior in reliably producing high-quality tips.},

  abstract = {The present research was aimed at exploiting and evaluating the potentialities of FT-NIR microscopy, as a complementary approach to analysis in the MIR region, for the chemical characterisation of paint cross sections. Even if FT-NIR technique is still underutilised in the field of cultural heritage investigations, the integrated use of information recorded in the NIR and in the MIR regions proved to be extremely useful in the molecular investigation of organic and inorganic substances. In fact, combination and overtone bands present in the NIR region, even if weaker and less selective than those in the MIR region, are not distorted by reflection phenomena. Furthermore, NIR spectra can be efficiently used as a spectral fingerprint for the stratigraphic characterisation of paint cross sections. The proposed analytical protocol was applied on two historical samples, presenting different stratigraphic structures. Suitable chemometric methods were applied for the elaboration of multivariate chemical maps recorded in the range 700–7500cm−1. In particular, a comprehensive and efficient procedure based on an interactive brushing approach, which combines the structural information of the score scatter plots with the spatial information of the PC score maps, was used. Interestingly, NIR data allowed a thorough characterisation of paint structures, providing information for the identification of components and suggesting the differentiation among different types of proteins. Moreover, NIR spectra permitted to achieve an efficient distinction of different classes of natural resins, demonstrating that, even working at a microscopic level, the NIR region may support the identification of different terpenoid materials. Multivariate analysis performed on MIR data did not provide satisfactory results, probably due to the distortion of the spectra and overlapping of bands. Nevertheless, MIR outcomes were investigated to support the interpretation of NIR spectra and in attempt to define an integrated protocol for the characterisation of complex paint mixtures.},

  abstract = {Recent decisions by leading AI labs to either open-source their models or to restrict access to their models has sparked debate about whether, and how, increasingly capable AI models should be shared. Open-sourcing in AI typically refers to making model architecture and weights freely and publicly accessible for anyone to modify, study, build on, and use. This offers advantages such as enabling external oversight, accelerating progress, and decentralizing control over AI development and use. However, it also presents a growing potential for misuse and unintended consequences. This paper offers an examination of the risks and benefits of open-sourcing highly capable foundation models. While open-sourcing has historically provided substantial net benefits for most software and AI development processes, we argue that for some highly capable foundation models likely to be developed in the near future, open-sourcing may pose sufficiently extreme risks to outweigh the benefits. In such a case, highly capable foundation models should not be open-sourced, at least not initially. Alternative strategies, including non-open-source model sharing options, are explored. The paper concludes with recommendations for developers, standard-setting bodies, and governments for establishing safe and responsible model sharing practices and preserving open-source benefits where safe.},

Leveraging the theory of optimal prediction, we anticipate and then find that belief states are linearly represented in the residual stream of transformers, even in cases where the predicted belief state geometry has highly nontrivial fractal structure. We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a general framework connecting the structure of training data to the geometric structure of activations inside transformers.},

Here, transport measurements on AuSn               4               single crystals, a topological nodal-line semimetal candidate, reveal the presence of two-dimensional superconductivity with a transition temperature T               c               \textasciitilde{} 2.40\,K. The two-dimensional nature of superconductivity is verified by a Berezinsky–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, Bose-metal phase, and vortex dynamics interpreted in terms of thermally-assisted flux motion in two dimensions. The normal-state magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is found to be well described by the weak-antilocalization transport formula, which has been commonly observed in topological materials, strongly supporting the scenario that normal-state magnetotransport in AuSn               4               is dominated by the surface electrons of topological Dirac-cone states. The entire results are summarized in a phase diagram in the temperature–magnetic field plane, which displays different regimes of transport. The combination of two-dimensional superconductivity and surface-driven magnetotransport suggests the topological nature of superconductivity in AuSn               4               .},

  abstract = {The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination \& toxicity, (2) Privacy \& security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors \& misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic \& environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, \& limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of defects in materials science has changed tremendously over the last century. While one hundred years ago they were often ignored by scientists, nowadays they are in the spotlight of scientific interest and whole branches of technology have emerged from their skillful handling. The first part of this article gives a historical overview and discusses why defects are so important for modern material science. In the second part, we review the treatment of defects in semiconductors. We start by explaining the assumptions and approximations involved in ab-initio calculations and then discuss the treatment of defects in materials. In the third part, we focus on defects in metals. We discuss the theoretical treatment of vacancies in metals starting from experimental findings. The impact of improved theoretical techniques on the predictive power is discussed. This is illustrated with the role of vacancies in intermetallic compounds and random alloys. The last section deals with dislocations.},

  abstract = {Drumhead surface states that link together loops of nodal lines arise in Dirac nodal-line semimetals as a consequence of the topologically nontrivial band crossings. We used low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and Fourier-transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy to investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) properties of ZrSiTe. Our results show two scattering signals across portions of the drumhead state resolving the energy-momentum relationship through the occupied and unoccupied energy ranges it is predicted to span. Observation of this drumhead state is in contrast to previous studies on ZrSiS and ZrSiSe, where the QPI was dominated by topologically trivial bulk bands and surface states. Furthermore, we observe a near 𝐤→−𝐤 scattering process across the Γ point, enabled by scattering between the spin-split drumhead bands in this material, showing the persistence of the drumhead state even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.},

We directly visualize the existence of an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) that is pinned by atomic impurities. In strong tunneling conditions, the incommensurate CDW is depinned from impurities by the electric field from the STM tip. To explore the possible mechanism of this incommensurate CDW, we perform STM-based inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) to detect phonon excitations in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2 and measure the influence of atomic impurities on local phonon excitations. In comparison with the calculated vibrational density of states in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2, we find two branches of phonon excitations which correspond to the vibrations of Nb ions and S ions, and the strength of the local phonon excitations is insensitive to the atomic impurities. Our results demonstrate the coexistence of impurity-pinned incommensurate CDW and superconductivity in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2, and open a way for detecting atomic-scale phonon excitations in transition metal dichalcogenides with STM-based IETS.},

The lifetime of quasiparticles is considered in particular near a continuous classical or quantum phase transition, when the nature of quasiparticles on both sides of a transition into an ordered state changes. A new concept of critical quasiparticles near a quantum critical point is introduced, and applied to quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion metals. Fractional quasiparticles in systems of restricted dimensionality are reviewed. Dirac quasiparticles emerging in so-called Dirac materials are discussed. The more recent discoveries of topologically protected chiral quasiparticles in topological matter and Majorana quasiparticles in topological superconductors are briefly reviewed.},

Since the turn of the century, the field has rapidly spread to a vast array of defects and host crystals applicable to quantum communication, sensing, and computing. From simple spin resonance to long-distance remote entanglement, the complexity of working with spin defects is fast advancing, and requires an in-depth understanding of their spin, optical, charge, and material properties in this modern context. This is especially critical for discovering new relevant systems dedicated to specific quantum applications. In this review, we therefore expand upon all the key components with an emphasis on the properties of defects and the host material,on engineering opportunities and other pathways for improvement. Finally, this review aims to be as defect and material agnostic as possible, with some emphasis on optical emitters,providing a broad guideline for the field of solid-state spin defects for quantum information.},

  abstract = {Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn4 has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn4, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.},

Scanning tunnelling microscopy can be used to probe various topological phenomena, as well as complement results from other techniques. We discuss some of these proof-of-principle methodologies applied to probe topology, with particular attention to studies performed under a tunable vector magnetic field, which is a relatively new direction of recent focus. We then project the future possibilities for atomic-resolution tunnelling methods in providing new insights into topological matter.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Despite their highly anisotropic complex-oxidic nature, certain delafossite compounds (               e.g               ., PdCoO               2               , PtCoO               2               ) are the most conductive oxides known, for reasons that remain poorly understood. Their room-temperature conductivity can exceed that of Au, while their low-temperature electronic mean-free-paths reach an astonishing 20 μm. It is widely accepted that these materials must be ultrapure to achieve this, although the methods for their growth (which produce only small crystals) are not typically capable of such. Here, we report a different approach to PdCoO               2               crystal growth, using chemical vapor transport methods to achieve order-of-magnitude gains in size, the highest structural qualities yet reported, and record residual resistivity ratios (\,{$>$}\,440). Nevertheless, detailed mass spectrometry measurements on these materials reveal that they are not ultrapure in a general sense, typically harboring 100s-of-parts-per-million impurity levels. Through quantitative crystal-chemical analyses, we resolve this apparent dichotomy, showing that the vast majority of impurities are forced to reside in the Co-O octahedral layers, leaving the conductive Pd sheets highly pure (∼1 ppm impurity concentrations). These purities are shown to be in quantitative agreement with measured residual resistivities. We thus conclude that a sublattice purification mechanism is essential to the ultrahigh low-temperature conductivity and mean-free-path of metallic delafossites.},

  abstract = {Blind deconvolution is the problem of recovering a convolutional kernel a0 and an activation signal x0 from their convolution y = a0 x0. This problem is ill-posed without further constraints or priors. This paper studies the situation where the nonzero entries in the activation signal are sparsely and randomly populated. We normalize the convolution kernel to have unit Frobenius norm and cast the sparse blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. With this spherical constraint, every spurious local minimum turns out to be close to some signed shift truncation of the ground truth, under certain hypotheses. This benign property motivates an effective two stage algorithm that recovers the ground truth from the partial information offered by a suboptimal local minimum. This geometry-inspired algorithm recovers the ground truth for certain microscopy problems, also exhibits promising performance in the more challenging image deblurring problem. Our insights into the global geometry and the two stage algorithm extend to the convolutional dictionary learning problem, where a superposition of multiple convolution signals is observed.},

  abstract = {Quasiparticle interference (QPI) of the electronic states has been widely applied in scanning tunneling microscopy to analyze the electronic band structure of materials. Single-defect-induced QPI reveals defect-dependent interaction between a single atomic defect and electronic states, which deserves special attention. Due to the weak signal of single-defect-induced QPI, the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively low in a standard two-dimensional QPI measurement. In this paper, we introduce a projective quasiparticle interference (PQPI) method in which a one-dimensional measurement is taken along high-symmetry directions centered on a specified defect. We apply the PQPI method to the topological nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. We focus on two special types of atomic defects that scatter the surface and bulk electronic bands. With an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in PQPI, the energy dispersions are clearly resolved along high-symmetry directions. We discuss the defect-dependent scattering of bulk bands with the nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced selection rules. Furthermore, an energy shift of the surface floating band is observed, and a branch of energy dispersion (𝒒6) is resolved. This PQPI method can be applied to other complex materials to explore defect-dependent interactions in the future.},

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals may open a new era in condensed matter physics, materials science, and nanotechnology after graphene and topological insulators. We report the first atomic scale view of the surface states of a Weyl semimetal (NbP) using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe coherent quantum interference patterns that arise from the scattering of quasiparticles near point defects on the surface. The measurements reveal the surface electronic structure both below and above the chemical potential in both real and reciprocal spaces. Moreover, the interference maps uncover the scattering processes of NbP’s exotic surface states. Through comparison between experimental data and theoretical calculations, we further discover that the orbital and/or spin texture of the surface bands may suppress certain scattering channels on NbP. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of electronic properties on Weyl semimetal surfaces.},
