\section{Experimental QPI measurement}
Real space \ac{QPI} signals are obtained by taking the grid map experiment on a region that presents \ac{QPI} patterns. In this section we will briefly explore \ac{QPI} measurement in the \ac{STM} experiment. We will do an overview of its experimental details, give standards on a good \ac{QPI} measurement by discussing the factors that dictates \ac{QPI} quality, and present the challenges to obtain an ideal \ac{QPI} measurement.

As mentioned in Ch.2, taking a grid map is very involved. A successful grid map requires both an ideal instrumental setup, and a deep understanding in the targeting material to set proper measurement parameters. 

\subsubsection{QPI quality}
Factors determining quality of a QPI measurement, and what is an ideal quality. 
1. high resolution in q-space <-> range in real-space
2. high range in q-space <-> resolution in real-space
3. low noise level-> machine's intrinsic noise level, voltage sweeps and averaging.
4. no phase noise
