\section{QPI measurements}
In this section we will explore how to obtain a QPI measurement in \ac{STM}. And one specific challenge 

\subsubsection{QPI quality}
Factors determining quality of a QPI measurement, and what is an ideal quality. 
1. high resolution in q-space <-> range in real-space
2. high range in q-space <-> resolution in real-space
3. low noise level-> machine's intrinsic noise level, voltage sweeps and averaging.
4. no phase noise
