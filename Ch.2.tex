%\section{STM and transport: 2D and 3D}
%From 2D to 3D, what can we say from STM and what we can not. 1) defect density-> cleaving, scanning etc induced impurities. 2D surface defect number may not represent the bulk-> more 3D materials. 2) defect scattering -> All defect scattering in STM will reflect to the bulk.
