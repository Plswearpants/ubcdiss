\section{Defect scattering under STM}

\section{STM and transport: 2D and 3D}
From 2D to 3D, what can we say from STM and what we can not. 
1) defect density-> cleaving, scanning etc induced impurities. 2D surface defect number may not represent the bulk-> more 3D materials. 
2) defect scattering -> All defect scattering in STM will reflect to the bulk.
