\section{A Multi-Channel Sparse Blind Deconvolution approach to STM}

In this chapter, we will introduce our approach to address \ac{MC-SBD} problem, we achieve this by first briefly introducing the existing methods, including our methods    
we first briefly review the existing methods to address \ac{MC-SBD}, 

\ac{MC-SBD}, also known as the joint sparse blind deconvolution/demixing problem is a bilinear problem, that is, the observed signal is modeled as a convolution (or equivalent linear operation) between pairs of two unknownsâ€”and this operation is linear in each variable when the other is fixed, but not jointly linear. It is known that a bilinear problem can not be made 
A common practice to simplify the bilinear problem is to lift it into a linear recovery problem, that is:
