\chapter{A new approach to STM analysis}
Conventional methods in analyzing grid maps from STM measurements face multiple fundamental  challenges. Recently, thanks to the maturation of optimization algorithms, a convolution data model for STM datasets was proposed by Cheung et al.\cite{cheungDictionaryLearningFouriertransform2020} and shows great potential. However,  despite its success in addressing some of the challenges, key shortcomings exist that prevent it being useful in most of the specimens studied by STM. In this chapter, we introduce a more general model that extends the convolution framework, we then showcase its performance with various benchmark tests, and apply it to real STM data as an illustration.
