  abstract = {Topological defects are singularities in an ordered phase that can have a profound effect on phase transitions and serve as a window into the order parameter. Examples of topological defects include dislocations in charge density waves and vortices in a superconductor or pair density wave, where the latter is a condensate of Cooper pairs with finite momentum. Here we demonstrate the role of topological defects in the magnetic-field-induced disappearance of a charge density wave in the heavy-fermion superconductor UTe2. We reveal pairs of topological defects of the charge density wave with positive and negative phase winding. The pairs are directly correlated with zeros in the charge density wave amplitude and increase in number with increasing magnetic field. A magnetic field generates vortices of the superconducting and pair density wave orders that can create topological defects in the charge density wave and induce the experimentally observed melting of this charge order at the upper critical field. Our work reveals the important role of magnetic-field-generated topological defects in the melting of the charge density wave order parameter in UTe2 and provides support for the existence of a pair density wave order on the surface.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side effects” and “avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration” and “distributional shift”). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

  abstract = {Raman microscopy is a powerful analytical technique for materials and life sciences that enables mapping the spatial distribution of the chemical composition of a sample. State-of-the-art Raman microscopes, based on point-scanning frequency-domain detection, have long (∼1s) pixel dwell times, making it challenging to acquire images of a significant area (e.g.,\&\#x00A0;100×100µm). Here we present a compact wide-field Raman microscope based on a time-domain Fourier-transform approach, which enables parallel acquisition of the Raman spectra on all pixels of a 2D detector. A common-path birefringent interferometer with exceptional delay stability and reproducibility can rapidly acquire Raman maps (∼30m i n for a 250000p i x e l image) with high spatial (\&lt;1µm) and spectral (∼23c m −1) resolutions. Time-domain detection allows us to disentangle fluorescence and Raman signals, which can both be measured separately. We validate the system by Raman imaging plastic microbeads and demonstrate its multimodal operation by capturing fluorescence and Raman maps of a multilayer-W S e 2 sample, providing complementary information on the strain and number of layers of the material.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

Such compounds necessarily host unique states on their boundaries. Scanning tunneling microscopy studies of these surface states have provided a wealth of spectroscopic characterization, with the successful cooperation of ab initio calculations. The method of quasiparticle interference imaging proves to be particularly useful for probing the dispersion relation of the surface bands. Herein, how a variety of additional fundamental electronic properties can be probed via this method is reviewed. It is demonstrated how quasiparticle interference measurements entail mesoscopic size quantization and the electronic phase coherence in semiconducting nanowires; helical spin protection and energy-momentum fluctuations in a topological insulator; and the structure of the Bloch wave function and the relative insusceptibility of topological electronic states to surface potential in a topological Weyl semimetal.},

  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇 =0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

  abstract = {Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems1. Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.},

  abstract = {We show that the impurity-induced Friedel oscillations allow one to probe in an unexpected and quite remarkable manner the electronic properties of two-dimensional systems such as graphene or high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we show that by studying these oscillations, one can get access not only to the constant-energy maps, but also to more hidden information such as the chiral properties of Dirac electrons in graphene, which cannot be observed directly by other methods. For graphene, this hidden information is revealed by comparing the theoretical predictions with scanning tunneling microscopy experimental measurements of the local density of states. Résumé Nous montrons comment les oscillations de Friedel induites par la présence d'une impureté permettent de sonder de manière inattendue et tout à fait remarquable les propriétés électroniques des systèmes bidimensionnels tels que le graphène ou les supraconducteurs à haute température. En particulier, nous montrons que par l'étude de ces oscillations, on peut obtenir accès pas seulement à la structure de bande, mais aussi à des informations cachées comme les propriétés chirales des électrons de Dirac dans le graphène, qui ne peuvent pas être observés directement par d'autres méthodes. Pour le graphène, cette information est révélée par la comparaison entre les prédictions théoriques et les mesures expérimentales de la densité locale d'états par la microscopie à effet tunnel.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly, and companies are shifting their focus to developing generalist AI systems that can autonomously act and pursue goals. Increases in capabilities and autonomy may soon massively amplify AI’s impact, with risks that include large-scale social harms, malicious uses, and an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous AI systems. Although researchers have warned of extreme risks from AI1, there is a lack of consensus about how exactly such risk arise, and how to manage them. Society’s response, despite promising first steps, is incommensurate with the possibility of rapid, transformative progress that is expected by many experts. AI safety research is lagging. Present governance initiatives lack the mechanisms and institutions to prevent misuse and recklessness, and barely address autonomous systems. In this short consensus paper, we describe extreme risks from upcoming, advanced AI systems. Drawing on lessons learned from other safety-critical technologies, we then outline a comprehensive plan combining technical research and development (R\&D) with proactive, adaptive governance mechanisms for a more commensurate preparation.},

  abstract = {Understanding AI systems’ inner workings is critical for ensuring value alignment and safety. This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding. We establish foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. We survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety. We examine benefits in understanding, control, alignment, and risks such as capability gains and dual-use concerns. We investigate challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation. We advocate for clarifying concepts, setting standards, and scaling techniques to handle complex models and behaviors and expand to domains such as vision and reinforcement learning. Mechanistic interpretability could help prevent catastrophic outcomes as AI systems become more powerful and inscrutable.

Here we introduce the Quantum Point Defect (QPOD) database with more than 1900 defect systems comprising various charge states of 503 intrinsic point defects (vacancies and antisites) in 82 different 2D semiconductors and insulators. The Atomic Simulation Recipes (ASR) workflow framework was used to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect formation energies, charge transition levels, Fermi level positions, equilibrium defect and carrier concentrations, transition dipole moments, hyperfine coupling, and zero-field splitting. Excited states and photoluminescence spectra were calculated for selected high-spin defects. In this paper we describe the calculations and workflow behind the QPOD database, present an overview of its content, and discuss some general trends and correlations in the data. We analyse the degree of defect tolerance as well as intrinsic dopability of the host materials and identify promising defects for quantum technological applications. The database is freely available and can be browsed via a web-app interlinked with the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).},

In particular, synthetic data are a promising concept toward solving the aporetic conflict between data privacy and data sharing. Yet, it is known that accurately generating private, synthetic data of certain kinds is NP-hard. We develop a statistical framework for differentially private synthetic data, which enables us to circumvent the computational hardness of the problem. We consider the true data as a random sample drawn from a population Ømega according to some unknown density. We then replace Ømega by a much smaller random subset Ømega \textsuperscript{\textbackslash ast} , which we sample according to some known density. We generate synthetic data on the reduced space Ømega \textsuperscript{\textbackslash ast} by fitting the specified linear statistics obtained from the true data. To ensure privacy we use the common Laplacian mechanism. Employing the concept of Rényi condition number, which measures how well the sampling distribution is correlated with the population distribution, we derive explicit bounds on the privacy and accuracy provided by the proposed method.},

This has sparked widespread demands for regulation. Central to the debate about how to regulate foundation models is the process by which foundation models are released (                                1                              )—whether they are made available only to the model developers, fully open to the public, or somewhere in between.

Others indicate two, suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here we report on temperature dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy of Pb-Bi2Sr2CuO6+x.

  abstract = {Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the internal mechanisms learned by neural networks. Despite recent progress toward this goal, it remains unclear how best to decompose neural network parameters into mechanistic components. We introduce Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), a method that directly decomposes a neural network's parameters into components that (i) are faithful to the parameters of the original network, (ii) require a minimal number of components to process any input, and (iii) are maximally simple. Our approach thus optimizes for a minimal length description of the network's mechanisms. We demonstrate APD's effectiveness by successfully identifying ground truth mechanisms in multiple toy experimental settings: Recovering features from superposition; separating compressed computations; and identifying cross-layer distributed representations. While challenges remain to scaling APD to non-toy models, our results suggest solutions to several open problems in mechanistic interpretability, including identifying minimal circuits in superposition, offering a conceptual foundation for 'features', and providing an architecture-agnostic framework for neural network decomposition.},

The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given. Having grown out of a set of lecture notes, and containing many pedagogical exercises, this book is designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course, and is also well suited for self-study.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 [Ope23], was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

We observe quasiparticle interference in the strongly Rashba split 2DEG-like surface band found at the tellurium termination of BiTeBr and examine two mechanisms governing quasiparticle scattering: We confirm the suppression of spin-flip scattering by comparing measured quasiparticle interference with a spin-dependent elastic scattering model applied to the calculated spectral function. We also use atomically resolved STM maps to identify point defect lattice sites and spectro-microscopy imaging to discern their varying scattering strengths, which we understand in terms of the calculated orbital characteristics of the surface band. Defects on the Bi sublattice cause the strongest scattering of the predominantly Bi 6p derived surface band, with other defects causing nearly no scattering near the conduction band minimum.}

  abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

We present Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning, a promising approach in AI Safety that could substantially improve our ability to build honest artificial intelligence. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on empathy, SOO aims to align how AI models represent themselves and others. Our experiments on LLMs with 7B, 27B, and 78B parameters demonstrate SOO's efficacy: deceptive responses of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 dropped from 73.6\% to 17.2\% with no observed reduction in general task performance, while in Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 deceptive responses were reduced from 100\% to 9.3\% and 2.7\%, respectively, with a small impact on capabilities. In reinforcement learning scenarios, SOO-trained agents showed significantly reduced deceptive behavior. SOO's focus on contrastive self and other-referencing observations offers strong potential for generalization across AI architectures. While current applications focus on language models and simple RL environments, SOO could pave the way for more trustworthy AI in broader domains. Ethical implications and long-term effects warrant further investigation, but SOO represents a significant step forward in AI safety research.},

In this work, we utilize low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT-STM/S) to elicit how distinct types of defects bring forth scattering potential engineering based on intervalley quantum quasiparticle interference (QPI) in TMDs. Furthermore, quantifying the energy-dependent phase variation of the QPI standing wave reveals the detailed electron–defect interaction between the substitution-induced scattering potential and the carrier transport mechanism. By exploring the intrinsic electronic behavior of atomic-level defects to further understand how defects affect carrier transport in low-dimensional semiconductors, we offer potential technological applications that may contribute to the future expansion of TMDs.},

Based on a modified Bardeen tunneling theory, explicit expressions for the tunneling matrix elements for localized tip states are derived with use of the Green’s-function method. It is shown that by expanding the vacuum tail of the tip wave function in terms of spherical harmonics, the tunneling matrix elements are related to the derivatives of the sample wave functions at the nucleus of the apex atom (taken as the center of the spherical-harmonics expansion), in a simple and straightforward way. In addition, an independent derivation based on a general sum rule is also presented, which is valid in a number of curvilinear coordinate systems. In spherical coordinates, a general form of the derivative rule follows. In parabolic coordinates, similar results are obtained. Physical meanings of these matrix elements, as well as their implications to the imaging mechanism of scanning-tunneling microscopy, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modern high-resolution microscopes are commonly used to study specimens that have dense and aperiodic spatial structure. Extracting meaningful information from images obtained from such microscopes remains a formidable challenge. Fourier analysis is commonly used to analyze the structure of such images. However, the Fourier transform fundamentally suffers from severe phase noise when applied to aperiodic images. Here, we report the development of an algorithm based on nonconvex optimization that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space image. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier analysis, we show that this algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive information about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide superconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the complete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material.},

  abstract = {Through considerable effort and intuition, several recent works have reverse-engineered nontrivial behaviors of transformer models. This paper systematizes the mechanistic interpretability process they followed. First, researchers choose a metric and dataset that elicit the desired model behavior. Then, they apply activation patching to find which abstract neural network units are involved in the behavior. By varying the dataset, metric, and units under investigation, researchers can understand the functionality of each component. We automate one of the process' steps: to identify the circuit that implements the specified behavior in the model's computational graph. We propose several algorithms and reproduce previous interpretability results to validate them. For example, the ACDC algorithm rediscovered 5/5 of the component types in a circuit in GPT-2 Small that computes the Greater-Than operation. ACDC selected 68 of the 32,000 edges in GPT-2 Small, all of which were manually found by previous work. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.},

  abstract = {One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is \textbackslash textit\{polysemanticity\}, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is \textbackslash textit\{superposition\}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task \textbackslash citep\{wang2022interpretability\} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability.},

Under this assumption, these works aimed to reconstruct feature directions using sparse coding. We develop metrics to assess the success of these sparse coding techniques and test the validity of the linearity and sparsity assumptions. We show our metrics can predict the level of sparsity on synthetic sparse linear activations, and can distinguish between sparse linear data and several other distributions. We use our metrics to measure levels of sparsity in several language models. We find evidence that language model activations can be accurately modelled by sparse linear combinations of features, significantly more so than control datasets. We also show that model activations appear to be sparsest in the first and final layers.},

In contrast to the more common XMR in semi-metals, PtSn4 stands out as a rare example of a high carrier density multi-band metal exhibiting XMR, sparking an active debate about its microscopic origin. Here we report a sharp sensitivity of its XMR upon the field angle, with an almost complete collapse only for one specific current and field direction (B//b, I//a). Corroborated by band-structure calculations, we identify a singular open orbit on one of its Fermi surface sheets as the origin of this collapse. This remarkably switchable XMR resolves the puzzle in PtSn4 as a semi-classical effect of an ultra-pure, compensated carrier metal. It further showcases the importance of Ockham’s razor in uncommon magnetotransport phenomena and demonstrates the remarkable physical properties conventional metals can exhibit given they are superbly clean.},

  abstract = {When a diffuse object is illuminated with coherent laser light, the backscattered light will form an interference pattern on the detector. This pattern of bright and dark areas is called a speckle pattern. When there is movement in the object, the speckle pattern will change over time. Laser speckle contrast techniques use this change in speckle pattern to visualize tissue perfusion. We present and review the contribution of laser speckle contrast techniques to the field of perfusion visualization and discuss the development of the techniques.},

This paper provides a toy model where polysemanticity can be fully understood, arising as a result of models storing additional sparse features in "superposition." We demonstrate the existence of a phase change, a surprising connection to the geometry of uniform polytopes, and evidence of a link to adversarial examples. We also discuss potential implications for mechanistic interpretability.},

Nevertheless, crystal imperfections are not only inevitable features of crystalline solids but also are of primary importance in a great many properties of materials. However, among the crystal imperfections, point defects including vacancies and impurities may determine most of the physical properties of materials, e.g., electrical conduction, magnetism, and dielectrics, and processing concerning the kinetics via the diffusion. This chapter introduces the factors affecting the formation of solid solutions and equilibrium concentration of point defects, and the defect chemistry of ionic solids. Concerning the defect chemistry, defect reactions and defect equilibrium including the construction of Kröger–Vink diagrams are presented. The label of the defects for energy levels of donors and acceptors of metal oxides has further been clarified. Deep insight into an understanding of the issue concerning the choice of compensating defects has been provided.},

This problem has confounded engineers, physicists, and mathematicians for many decades. Recently, phase retrieval has seen a resurgence in research activity, ignited by new imaging modalities and novel mathematical concepts. As our scientific experiments produce larger and larger datasets and we aim for faster and faster throughput, it is becoming increasingly important to study the involved numerical algorithms in a systematic and principled manner. Indeed, the past decade has witnessed a surge in the systematic study of computational algorithms for phase retrieval. In this paper we will review these recent advances from a numerical viewpoint.},

In this paper, the applicability of the HiHTP algorithm for solving the bi-sparse blind deconvolution problem is studied. The bi-sparse blind deconvolution setting here consists of recovering \$h\$ and \$b\$ from the knowledge of \$h*(Qb)\$, where \$Q\$ is some linear operator, and both \$b\$ and \$h\$ are both assumed to be sparse. The approach rests upon lifting the problem to a linear one, and then applying HiHTP, through the \textbackslash emph\{hierarchical sparsity framework\}. \%In particular, the efficient HiHTP algorithm is proposed for performing the recovery. Then, for a Gaussian draw of the random matrix \$Q\$, it is theoretically shown that an \$s\$-sparse \$h \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{K\}\textasciicircum\textbackslash mu\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\$-sparse \$b \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{K\}\textasciicircum n\$ with high probability can be recovered when \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash succcurlyeq s\textbackslash log(s)\textasciicircum 2\textbackslash log(\textbackslash mu)\textbackslash log(\textbackslash mu n) + s\textbackslash sigma \textbackslash log(n)\$.},

  abstract = {Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.},

II. Zur Berechnung der Zug- und Schubfestigkeit wird ein angenähertes Verfahren benutzt, indem die potentielle Energie zweier Kristallhälften als eine Funktion ihrer relativen Verschiebung, bei Fehlen irgend einer Volumendeformation, betrachtet wird. Diese Energie wird auf Grund der elektrischen Theorie der Kohäsionskräfte für den absoluten Nullpunkt der Temperatur berechnet und durch eine zusätzliche „nicht Coulombsche“ Energie ergänzt. Daraus lassen sich näherungsweise die Elastizitätsmoduln und die entsprechenden Festigkeitsgrenzen (normale und tan-gentielle) berechnen, Es werden beispielsweise die (100)- und (1.10)-Ebenen von Steinsalz betrachtet. Die durch die Volumendeformation bedingte Korrektion ergibt sich an diesem Beispiel als unbeträchtlich. Die Temperaturabhängigkeit der Energie wird mittels der allgemeinen statistischen Prinzipien bestimmt. Für die Elastizitätsmoduln scheint zwischen Theorie und Erfahrung eine quantitative Übereinstimmung zu bestehen. Für die entsprechenden Festigkeitsgrenzen sind nur qualitative Schlüsse gezogen, die auch mit der Erfahrung übereinstimmen.},

Here, we find that the layer-structured Dirac semimetal PtSn               4               exhibits a largely suppressed thermal conductivity under a magnetic field. At low temperatures, a dramatic decrease in the thermal conductivity of PtSn               4               by more than two orders of magnitude is obtained at 9\,T. Moreover, PtSn               4               shows both strong longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric responses under a magnetic field. Large power factor and Nernst power factor of approximately 80–100\,               μ               W·cm               -1               ·K               -2               are obtained around 15\,K in various magnetic fields.

  abstract = {The present work deals with the investigation of the micromechanical behaviour of a duplex steel, which consists of two phases (austenite and ferrite) exhibiting significantly different mechanical properties. The stresses in both phases were experimentally determined in the elastic and plastic ranges of deformation using synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments. The used methodology enabled to determine the values of initial stresses and to study the evolutions of the principal phase stresses and the second order stresses during the elastic, as well as the plastic range of deformation. With the help of a self-consistent model, the critical resolved shear stresses and the work hardening parameters for slip systems, active in each phase, were also estimated. Comparison of the measured phase stresses and lattice strains evolutions with the model results showed a good agreement between prediction and experiment when the initial stress state in the sample and shape of grains approximated by ellipsoidal inclusions were taken into account. The overall outcome of the work is the determination of stress partitioning between the two phases of a polycrystalline material for all deformation stages, determined directly from diffraction experiment. The results enabled analyses of von Mises, hydrostatic stresses as well as second order stresses evolutions in both phases during tensile deformation. Finally, the experimental data were successfully compared with predictions of the self-consistent deformation model.},

  abstract = {Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians (WTBH) provide a computationally efficient way to predict electronic properties of materials. In this work, we develop a computational workflow for high-throughput Wannierization of density functional theory (DFT) based electronic band structure calculations. We apply this workflow to 1771 materials (1406 3D and 365 2D), and we create a database with the resulting WTBHs. We evaluate the accuracy of the WTBHs by comparing the Wannier band structures to directly calculated spin-orbit coupling DFT band structures. Our testing includes k-points outside the grid used in the Wannierization, providing an out-of-sample test of accuracy. We illustrate the use of WTBHs with a few example applications. We also develop a web-app that can be used to predict electronic properties on-the-fly using WTBH from our database. The tools to generate the Hamiltonian and the database of the WTB parameters are made publicly available through the websites https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvisand https://jarvis.nist.gov/jarviswtb.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

Three other common defects, including one also on an Fe site, are observed to break local lattice symmetry and are pair breaking, indicated by clear in-gap bound states, in addition to states near the smaller gap edge. STS maps reveal complex, extended real-space bound-state patterns, including one with a chiral distribution of the local density of states.

Our results reveal a kink in the otherwise parabolic band dispersion of the surface electrons and an increase in the quasiparticle lifetime near the Fermi energy 𝐸𝑓. The experimental data are accurately modeled with the 𝑇-matrix formalism for scattering from a single impurity, assuming that the surface electrons are dressed by the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. We confirm the latter as the interaction responsible for the deviations from bare dispersion. We further show how FT-STS can be used to simultaneously extract real and imaginary parts of the self-energy for both occupied and unoccupied states with a momentum and energy resolution competitive with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. From our quantitative analysis of the data we extract a Debye energy of ℏ⁢𝛺𝐷 =14 ±1 meV and an electron-phonon coupling strength of 𝜆 =0.13 ±0.02, consistent with previous results.

An interpretable dimension is such that a human can interpret the semantic (or syntactic) relations between words active for a dimension. These models are useful for critical downstream tasks in natural language processing (e.g. medical or legal NLP), and digital humanities applications. This work extends interpretability at the vector level with a more manageable number of activated dimensions following recommendations from psycholinguistics. Subsequently, one of the key criteria to an interpretable model is sparsity: in order to be interpretable, not every word should be represented by all the features of the model, especially if humans have to interpret these features and their relations. This raises one question: to which extent is sparsity sustainable with regard to performance? We thus introduce a sparsification procedure to evaluate its impact on two interpretable methods (SPINE and SINr) to tend towards sustainable vector interpretability. We also introduce stability as a new criterion to interpretability. Our stability evaluations show little albeit non-zero variation for SPINE and SINr embeddings. We then show that increasing sparsity does not necessarily interfere with performance. These results are encouraging and pave the way towards intrinsically interpretable word vectors.},

However, initial high-density dislocations in work-hardened materials are commonly asserted to be detrimental to ductility according to textbook strengthening theory. Inspired by the self-organized critical states of non-equilibrium complex systems in nature, we explored the mechanical response of an additively manufactured medium entropy alloy with segregation-dislocation self-organized structures (SD-SOS). We show here that when initial dislocations are in the form of SD-SOS, the textbook theory that dislocation hardening inevitably sacrifices ductility can be overturned. Our results reveal that the SD-SOS, in addition to providing dislocation sources by emitting dislocations and stacking faults, also dynamically interacts with gliding dislocations to generate sustainable Lomer-Cottrell locks and jogs for dislocation storage. The effective dislocation multiplication and storage capabilities lead to the continuous refinement of planar slip bands, resulting in high ductility in the work-hardened alloy produced by additive manufacturing. These findings set a precedent for optimizing the mechanical behavior of alloys via tuning dislocation configurations.},

  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies 𝐸⁡(k) and quasiparticle interactions 𝑓⁡(k, k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of 𝐸⁡(k). To estimate the derivative of 𝐸⁡(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for 𝑓. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

By studying the spatial decay of quasiparticle interference patterns (QPI) from point scatterers, we were able to directly and selectively extract the phase coherence length \$l\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}\$ and lifetime \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}\$ for the bulk DLN excitations, which are dominated by inelastic electron-electron scattering. We find that the experimental \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{QPI\}\}(E)\$ values below \$-\$40 meV are very short, likely due to the stronger Coulomb interactions, and lie at the Planckian limit \$\textbackslash hbar/|E|\$. Our results corroborate a growing body of experimental reports demonstrating unusual electronic correlation effects near a DLN.},

Typical mechanisms for the emergence of nodal lines involve mirror symmetry and the               π               Berry phase. Here we show via               ab initio               calculations that fcc calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and ytterbium (Yb) have topological nodal lines with the               π               Berry phase near the Fermi level, when spin–orbit interaction is neglected. In particular, Ca becomes a nodal-line semimetal at high pressure. Owing to nodal lines, the Zak phase becomes either               π               or 0, depending on the wavevector               k               , and the               π               Zak phase leads to surface polarization charge. Carriers eventually screen it, leaving behind large surface dipoles. In materials with nodal lines, both the large surface polarization charge and the emergent drumhead surface states enhance Rashba splitting when heavy adatoms are present, as we have shown to occur in Bi/Sr(111) and in Bi/Ag(111).},

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.}

  abstract = {Having previously been the subject of decades of semiconductor research, cadmium arsenide (Cd3⁢As2) has now reemerged as a topological material, realizing ideal three-dimensional Dirac points at the Fermi level. These topological Dirac points lead to a number of extraordinary transport phenomena, including strong quantum oscillations, large magnetoresistance, ultrahigh mobilities, and Fermi velocities exceeding graphene. The large mobilities persist even in thin films and nanowires of Cd3⁢As2, suggesting the involvement of topological surface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this material are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we present the computed Fermi-arc surface states of a Cd3⁢As2 thin film, based on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure. We show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs are very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone. The shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side scattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase space. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong electric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological insulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties. Crucially, the mechanisms suppressing scattering in this material differ from those in other topological materials such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators, suggesting a new route for engineering high-mobility devices based on Dirac semimetal surface states.},

Phases of a recently published data set for glucose-embedded specimens [1] were used for the difference Fourier map. Moderate resolution (9 Å) and high resolution (4.25 Å) maps both indicate that glucose is exchangeable for water in the region of the map corresponding to the lipid regions. We interpret this as indicating that there is a small surface depression in this region of the structure. The depth of this feature is estimated to be 16 the thickness of the protein region in the membrane. The data obtained in this study rules out the existence of an aqueous transmembrane channel, the dimensions of which are large enough to allow free exchange of glucose for water. Several new features are also observed in the protein region of the membrane. These features are probably due to segments of the polypeptide at the aqueous interface that are well ordered in frozen-hydrated specimens but not in glucose-embedded specimens. Candidate structures for the origin of these features are extensions of the helices, or linker regions connecting the helices.},

Here we discover previously unidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface electronic structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. By performing simultaneous spin, time, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we map the spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structure and identify a surface resonance which is distinct from the topological surface state, yet shares a similar spin-orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum dependence and spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological surface state. Calculations show these two distinct states can emerge from trivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced band inversion. This work thus provides a compelling view of the coevolution of surface states through a topological phase transition, enabled by the unique capability of directly measuring the spin-polarized unoccupied band structure.},

In this study, we employ density-functional theory (DFT) and self-consistent phonon (SCP) calculations to investigate finite-temperature phonons in cubic niobate perovskites. To include explicit anharmonic vibrational effects, SCP frequencies are shifted by the bubble self-energy correction within the quasiparticle (QP) approximation, providing precise descriptions of phonon softening in these strongly anharmonic solids. We further calculate the static dielectric constant of KNbO3 and NaNbO3 as a function of temperature using the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation and QP-corrected phonon dispersions. Our theoretical results align with experimental data, offering reliable temperature-dependent phonon dispersions while considering anharmonic self-energies and thermal expansion effects, enhancing our understanding of the complex relations between lattice vibrations and phase transitions in these anharmonic oxides.},

We also revisit the Young fringe method in the light of the 3D Fourier transform, and have found a considerable amount of non-linear terms in Young fringes at 80kV even from a typical standard specimen, such as an amorphous Ge thin film.},

  abstract = {Electron scattering in the topological surface state (TSS) of the topological insulator Bi1.5⁢Sb0.5⁢Te1.7⁢Se1.3 was studied using quasiparticle interference observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. It was found that not only the 180° backscattering but also a wide range of backscattering angles of 100°–180° are effectively prohibited in the TSS. This conclusion was obtained by comparing the observed scattering vectors with the diameters of the constant-energy contours of the TSS, which were measured for both occupied and unoccupied states using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The robust protection from backscattering in the TSS is good news for applications, but it poses a challenge to the theoretical understanding of the transport in the TSS.},

With increasing carbon contents from 0.1 C to 0.5 C, the austenite phase fraction among the constituent phases increased from \textasciitilde 66\% to \textasciitilde 98\%, and stacking fault energy (SFE) increased from \textasciitilde 0.65 to \textasciitilde 16.5 mJ/m2. The 0.1 C and 0.3 C steels underwent phase transformation from γ-austenite to ε-martensite or α’-martensite during tensile deformation. On the other hand, the 0.5 C steel underwent phase transformation only from γ-austenite to ε-martensite. The 0.3 C steel exhibited a low yield strength, a high strain hardening rate, and the smallest elongation. The high strain hardening of the 0.3 C alloy was due to a rapid phase transformation rate from γ-austenite to ε-martensite. The austenite of 0.5 C steel was strengthened by mechanical twinning during loading process, and the twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effect resulted in a large ductility. The 0.5 wt.\% carbon addition stabilized the austenite phase by delaying the onset of the ε-martensite phase transformation.},

There have been many attempts to measure the symmetry of this parameter in the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 - δ (refs 3–10), but they have not yielded consistent results. Here we show that half-integer flux quantization in superconducting rings with three grain-boundary Josephson junctions, which formed the basis of an earlier, less conclusive symmetry test3, can be used to place firm constraints on the pairing symmetry. For the case of YBa2Cu3O7 - δ, we find that the sign of the order parameter is clearly direction dependent (consistent with a dx2-y2 symmetry) and that the contribution from any out-of-phase isotropic component is less than about 3\%.},

  abstract = {Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement. Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer 𝛼−RuCl3, the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations unique to 𝛼−RuCl3. Numerical simulations suggest that the observed oscillation can be reproduced by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects like Friedel oscillations in metals.},

  abstract = {In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, electron scattering off impurities depends on both spin and orbital angular momentum of electrons – spin-orbit scattering. Although some transport properties are subject to spin-orbit scattering, experimental techniques directly accessible to this effect are limited. Here we show that a signature of spin-orbit scattering manifests itself in quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaged by spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. The experimental data of a polar semiconductor BiTeI are well reproduced by numerical simulations with the T -matrix formalism that include not only scalar scattering normally adopted but also spin-orbit scattering stronger than scalar scattering. To accelerate the simulations, we extend the standard efficient method of QPI calculation for momentum-independent scattering to be applicable even for spin-orbit scattering. We further identify a selection rule that makes spin-orbit scattering visible in the QPI pattern. These results demonstrate that spin-orbit scattering can exert predominant influence on QPI patterns and thus suggest that QPI measurement is available to detect spin-orbit scattering.},

  abstract = {Tunneling spectroscopy is an important tool for the study of both real- and momentum-space electronic structure of correlated electron systems. However, such measurements often yield noisy data. Machine learning provides techniques to reduce the noise in postprocessing, but traditionally requires noiseless examples which are unavailable for scientific experiments. In this work we adapt the unsupervised Noise2Noise and self-supervised Noise2Self algorithms, which allow for denoising without clean examples, to denoise quasiparticle interference data. We first apply the techniques on simulated data, and demonstrate that we are able to reduce the noise while preserving finer details, all while outperforming more traditional denoising techniques. We then apply the Noise2Self technique to experimental data from an overdoped cuprate [(Pb,Bi)2⁢Sr2⁢CuO6+𝛿] sample. Denoising enhances the clarity of quasiparticle interference patterns, and helps to obtain a precise extraction of electronic structure parameters. Self-supervised denoising is a promising tool for denoising quasiparticle interference data, facilitating deeper insights into the physics of complex materials.},

The determined turnover frequency (TOF) for each active site of PtSn4 is 1.54 H2 s−1 at 100 mV. This sets a benchmark for HER catalysis on Pt-based noble metals and earth-abundant metal catalysts. We make use of the robust surface states of PtSn4 as their electrons can be transferred to the adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the catalytic process more efficiently.

  abstract = {We study the question of extracting a sequence of functions \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i, \textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\textbackslash\}\_\{i=1\}\textasciicircum s\$ from observing only the sum of their convolutions, i.e., from \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{y\} = \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\textasciicircum s \textbackslash boldsymbol\{f\}\_i\textbackslash ast \textbackslash boldsymbol\{g\}\_i\$. While convex optimization techniques are able to solve this joint blind deconvolution-demixing problem provably and robustly under certain conditions, for medium-size or large-size problems we need computationally faster methods without sacrificing the benefits of mathematical rigor that come with convex methods. In this paper, we present a non-convex algorithm which guarantees exact recovery under conditions that are competitive with convex optimization methods, with the additional advantage of being computationally much more efficient. Our two-step algorithm converges to the global minimum linearly and is also robust in the presence of additive noise. While the derived performance bounds are suboptimal in terms of the information-theoretic limit, numerical simulations show remarkable performance even if the number of measurements is close to the number of degrees of freedom. We discuss an application of the proposed framework in wireless communications in connection with the Internet-of-Things.},

  abstract = {There are two prominent applications of the mathematical concept of topology to the physics of materials: band topology, which classifies different topological insulators and semimetals, and topological defects that represent immutable deviations of a solid lattice from its ideal crystalline form. While these two classes of topological phenomena have generally been treated as separate topics, recent experimental advancements have begun to probe their intricate and surprising interactions, in real materials as well as synthetic metamaterials. Topological lattice defects in topological materials offer a platform to explore a diverse range of novel phenomena, such as topological pumping via topological defects, embedded topological phases, synthetic dimensions, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In this Perspective, we survey the developments in this rapidly moving field, and give an outlook of its impact on materials science and applications.},

  abstract = {Topological Dirac nodal-line semimetals host topologically nontrivial electronic structure with nodal-line crossings around the Fermi level, which could affect the photocarrier dynamics and lead to novel relaxation mechanisms. Herein, by using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the previously-inaccessible linear dispersions of the bulk conduction bands above the Fermi level in a Dirac nodal-line semimetal PtSn\$\_4\$, as well as the momentum and temporal evolution of the gapless nodal lines. A surprisingly ultrafast relaxation dynamics within a few hundred femtoseconds is revealed for photoexcited carriers in the nodal line. Theoretical calculations suggest that such ultrafast carrier relaxation is attributed to the multichannel scatterings among the complex metallic bands of PtSn\$\_4\$ via electron-phonon coupling. In addition, a unique dynamic relaxation mechanism contributed by the highly anisotropic Dirac nodal-line electronic structure is also identified. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the ultrafast carrier dynamics in a Dirac nodal-line semimetal.},

  abstract = {Advances in the use of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study mechanical deformation have enabled a direct correlation of mechanical properties with microstructures, in particular, atomic-level defect dynamic processes. Shear deformation of metallic materials has been noticed to lead to unique microstructural features with superior properties that would be difficult to achieve by traditional metallurgical processes. However, in contrast to the case of in situ TEM studies of structural evolution under tension, compression, and bending, in situ TEM probing of dynamic processes during direct shear loading, especially at microscales and nanoscales, is very limited. This paper reviews recent progress on the development of in situ TEM for studying shear deformation in terms of both the technique and the scientific insights that have been gained. In addition, we discuss current challenges encountered in the use of in situ TEM for shear deformation, such as the limited total strain, strain rate, and spatial and temporal resolution. To provide perspective, we present promising opportunities for in situ TEM studies with pure shear loading by taking advantage of the integration of advanced imaging techniques both in TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy domains, advanced electron detectors, highly efficient chemical analysis, data-driven machine learning, and environmental conditions.},

In photonics, such edge states lead to unidirectional waveguides which are useful for integrated photonic circuitry. Cavity modes, another type of fundamental component in photonic chips, however, are not protected by band topology because of their lower dimensions. Here we demonstrate that concurrent wavevector space and real-space topology, dubbed as dual-topology, can lead to light-trapping in lower dimensions. The resultant photonic-bound state emerges as a Jackiw–Rebbi soliton mode localized on a dislocation in a two-dimensional photonic crystal, as proposed theoretically and discovered experimentally. Such a strongly confined cavity mode is found to be robust against perturbations. Our study unveils a mechanism for topological light-trapping in lower dimensions, which is invaluable for fundamental physics and various applications in photonics.},

  abstract = {Most natural and artificial materials have crystalline structures from which abundant topological phases emerge1-6. However, the bulk-edge correspondence-which has been widely used in experiments to determine the band topology from edge properties-is inadequate in discerning various topological crystalline phases7-16, leading to challenges in the experimental classification of the large family of topological crystalline materials4-6. It has been theoretically predicted that disclinations-ubiquitous crystallographic defects-can provide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges17-19, but this has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here we report an experimental demonstration of bulk-disclination correspondence, which manifests as fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the disclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from the symmetry-protected bulk charge patterns-a fundamental property of many topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Furthermore, the robust bound states at disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable, property of TCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order topology, we observe these hallmark features via pump-probe and near-field detection measurements. It is shown that both the fractional charge and the localized states emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the trivial phase. This experimental demonstration of bulk-disclination correspondence reveals a fundamental phenomenon and a paradigm for exploring topological materials.},

However, it has become clear that atomic defects undermine the stabilization of such quantum phases as they lead to spatial variations in the surface state gap and doping levels. The large number of possible defect configurations in MBST make studying the influence of individual defects virtually impossible. Here, we present a statistical analysis of the nanoscale effect of defects in MBST with x=0.64, by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy. We identify (Bi,Sb)Mn anti-site defects to be the main source of the observed doping fluctuations, leading towards the formation of nanoscale charge puddles and effectively closing the transport gap. Our findings will guide further optimization of this material system via defect engineering, to enable exploitation of its promising properties.},

A method for probing optically inactive spin defects would reveal semiconductor physics at the atomic scale and advance the study of new quantum systems. We exploit the intrinsic correlation between the charge and spin states of defect centers to measure the charge populations and dynamics of single substitutional nitrogen spin defects in diamond. By probing their steady-state spin population, read out at the single-defect level with a nearby nitrogen vacancy center, we directly measure the defect ionization—corroborated by first-principles calculations—an effect we do not have access to with traditional coherence-based quantum sensing.},

Yet, being a surface-sensitive technique, the interpretation of QPI only works well for anisotropic materials, where the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the surface can be neglected and the quasiparticle interference is dominated by a quasi-2D electronic structure. Here, we explore QPI imaging of galena, a material with an electronic structure that does not exhibit pronounced anisotropy. We find that the quasiparticle interference signal is dominated by scattering vectors which are parallel to the surface plane however originate from bias-dependent cuts of the 3D electronic structure. We develop a formalism for the theoretical description of the QPI signal and demonstrate how this quasiparticle tomography can be used to obtain information about the 3D electronic structure and orbital character of the bands.},

  abstract = {Impurities in superconductors and their induced bound states are important both for engineering novel states such as Majorana zero-energy modes and for probing bulk properties of the superconducting state. The high-temperature cuprates offer a clear advantage in a much larger superconducting order parameter, but the nodal energy spectrum of a pure d-wave superconductor only allows virtual bound states. Fully gapped d-wave superconducting states have, however, been proposed in several cuprate systems thanks to subdominant order parameters producing d\,+\,is- or d\,+\,id′-wave superconducting states. Here we study both magnetic and potential impurities in these fully gapped d-wave superconductors. Using analytical T-matrix and complementary numerical tight-binding lattice calculations, we show that magnetic and potential impurities behave fundamentally different in d\,+\,is- and d\,+\,id′-wave superconductors. In a d\,+\,is-wave superconductor, there are no bound states for potential impurities, while a magnetic impurity produces one pair of bound states, with a zero-energy level crossing at a finite scattering strength. On the other hand, a d\,+\,id′-wave symmetry always gives rise to two pairs of bound states and only produce a reachable zero-energy level crossing if the normal state has a strong particle-hole asymmetry.},

Free exciton emission was clearly observed at low temperatures and dominated the PL spectrum above 100 K. Emission from 𝐴 excitons bound to three neutral donors dominated the low-temperature PL spectrum. Recombination of 𝐵 excitons bound to these same neutral donors were also identified along with 𝐴 excitons bound to the donors in their ionized state. A clear difference in the redshift of free and bound excitons with increasing temperature was observed and attributed to reduced exciton-phonon coupling for the bound excitons. Additionally, Fano resonance of the 1-LO replica of the dominant bound 𝐴 exciton was observed to reduce its PL intensity which can lead to the misidentification of the 2-LO replica as a donor-acceptor-pair transition.},

This is the status of bulk bismuth. Recent studies have classified it as either a strong or a higher-order topological insulator, both of which host helical modes on their boundaries. We resolve the topological classification of bismuth by spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary modes to a screw-dislocation. We find that the one-dimensional mode, on step-edges, extends over a wide energy range and does not open a gap near the screw-dislocations. This signifies that this mode binds to the screw-dislocation, as expected for a material with nonzero weak indices. We argue that the small energy gap, at the time reversal invariant momentum               L               , positions bismuth within the critical region of a topological phase transition between a higher-order topological insulator and a strong topological insulator with nonzero weak indices.},

As-grown Bi2Te3 crystals contain vacancies, antisites, and interstitial defects that may result in bulk conductivity and therefore may change the insulating bulk character. Here, we demonstrate the interplay between the growth conditions and the density of different types of native near-surface defects. In particular, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the dependence on not only the local atomic environment but also on the growth kinetics and the resulting sample doping from n-type toward intrinsic crystals with the Fermi level positioned inside the energy gap. Our results establish a bias-dependent STM signature of the Bi2Te3 native defects and shed light on the link between the native defects and the electronic properties of Bi2Te3, which is relevant for the synthesis of topological insulator materials and the related functional properties.},

Simple physical arguments are given which show that the high-density calculation of Gell-Mann and Brueckner is valid for 𝑟𝑠 ≲1 while the low-density calculation of Wigner is valid for 𝑟𝑠≳20. For actual metallic densities it is shown that the contribution to the correlation energy from long-wavelength momentum transfers (𝑘 {$<$}𝛽⁢𝑘0 {$<$}0.47⁢𝑟𝑠12⁢𝑘0) may be accurately calculated in the random phase approximation. This contribution is calculated using the Bohm-Pines extended Hamiltonian, and is shown to be 𝐸⁡(𝛽) =(−0.458⁢𝛽2𝑟𝑠+0.866⁢𝛽3𝑟𝑠32−0.98⁢𝛽4𝑟𝑠2)⁢(+0.019⁢𝛽4𝑟𝑠+0.706⁢𝛽5𝑟𝑠52+⋯)⁢ry. An identical result is obtained by a suitable expansion of the result of Gell-Mann and Brueckner; the validity of the Bohm-Pines neglect of subsidiary conditions in the calculation of the ground-state energy is thereby explicitly established. The contribution to the correlation energy from sufficiently high momentum transfers (𝑘≳𝑘0) will arise only from the interaction between electrons of antiparallel spin, and may be estimated using second-order perturbation theory. The contribution arising from intermediate momentum transfers (0.47⁢𝑟𝑠12⁢𝑘0 ≲𝑘 ≲𝑘0) cannot be calculated analytically; the interpolation procedures for this domain proposed by Pines and Hubbard are shown to be nearly identical, and their accuracy is estimated as ∼15\%. The result for the over-all correlation energy using the interpolation procedure of Pines is 𝐸𝑐≅(−0.115 +0.031⁢ln⁡𝑟𝑠)⁢ry.},

  abstract = {"Induction heads" are attention heads that implement a simple algorithm to complete token sequences like [A][B] ... [A] -{$>$} [B]. In this work, we present preliminary and indirect evidence for a hypothesis that induction heads might constitute the mechanism for the majority of all "in-context learning" in large transformer models (i.e. decreasing loss at increasing token indices). We find that induction heads develop at precisely the same point as a sudden sharp increase in in-context learning ability, visible as a bump in the training loss. We present six complementary lines of evidence, arguing that induction heads may be the mechanistic source of general in-context learning in transformer models of any size. For small attention-only models, we present strong, causal evidence; for larger models with MLPs, we present correlational evidence.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.},

In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.},

  abstract = {Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.},

  abstract = {We re-examine the problem of a magnetic impurity coupled to a superconductor focusing on the role of quantum fluctuations. We study in detail a system that consists of a one-dimensional charge conserving spin-singlet superconductor coupled to a boundary magnetic impurity. Our main finding is that quantum fluctuations lead to the destruction of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) intragap bound states in all but a narrow region of the phase diagram. We carry out our analysis in three stages, increasing the role of the quantum fluctuations at each stage. First we consider the limit of a classical impurity and study the bulk semiclassically, finding YSR states throughout the phase diagram, a situation similar to conventional BCS superconductors. In the second stage, we reintroduce quantum fluctuations in the bulk and find that the YSR state is suppressed over half of the phase diagram, existing only around the quantum critical point separating the unscreened and the partially screened phases. In the final stage we solve exactly the full interacting model with arbitrary coupling constants using the Bethe ansatz. We find that including both the quantum fluctuating bulk and quantum impurity destabilizes the YSR state over most of the phase diagram allowing it to exist only in a small region, the YSR regime, between a Kondo-screened and an unscreened regime. Within the YSR regime a first-order phase transition occurs between a spin singlet and doublet ground state. We also find that for large-enough impurity spin exchange interaction a renormalized Kondo-screened regime is established. In this regime, not found for BCS superconductors, there is no YSR state and a renormalized Kondo temperature scale is generated.},

It is suggested that the observed quadratic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at low temperatures in zero field can be due to, in addition to electron-electron scattering, the “electron-phonon-surface” interference scattering mechanism. The transition from high effective magnetic fields to weak ones, which is observed in compensated conductors with a closed Fermi surface, was proposed as a possible explanation for the minimum on the temperature dependence of the resistivity of PtSn4 and WTe2 in a magnetic field.

For these models we use the T-matrix formalism to calculate the quasiparticle interference patterns generated in the presence of impurity scattering. In particular, we consider the models introduced in Phys. Rev. B 93, 041109(R) (A) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 076801 (B), and we find that, as opposed to observations previously obtained via joint density of states and spin-dependent scattering probability, the inter-arc scattering in the quasiparticle interference features is fully suppressed in model A, and very small in model B. Our findings indicate that these models may not correctly describe materials such as MoTe2, since for such materials inter-arc scattering is clearly visible experimentally, e.g., in Nature Phys. 12, 1105-1110 (2016). We also focus on the minimal models proposed by McCormick et al. in Phys. Rev. B 95, 075133, which indeed recover significant inter-arc scattering features.},

However, several recent experiments have detected signatures of bulk metallicity within this Kondo insulating phase. In this study, we visualized the real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using a scanning tunneling microscope. We discovered nanometer-scale puddles of metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the heavy-fermion compound uranium ruthenium silicide (URu2Si2) and around samarium-site defects in the topological Kondo insulator samarium hexaboride (SmB6). These defects disturbed the Kondo screening cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results suggest that the three-dimensional quantum oscillations measured in SmB6 arise from Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot exclude other explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.},

In this paper, Prof. Perrin gave a detailed account of his work upon the distribution in fluids of small particles, which show the Brownian movement, and the bearing of these results on the kinetic theory of matter. An interesting survey is first given of the historical development cf this subject. The English naturalist, Brown, directed attention in 1827 to the fact that small particles suspended in liquids were always in a state of rapid but irregular movement. Comparatively little notice was paid to this observation until 1889, when Gouy showed that the Brownian movement could not be ascribed to temperature differences,but was a persistent effect which was probably a necessary consequence of the kinetic theory of matter. Since that time a large amount of interesting work has been done, especially by Continental workers, to throw further light on the magnitude and nature of the Brownian movement.},

Herein, a Green function-based formalism is derived for the ab initio computation of Fourier-transformed QPI images.

The defect located far from the boundary is found to produce two bound states independently of the sign of its potential. The states are classified as electronlike and holelike. Each of these states can have two types of spatial distribution of the electron density. The first-type states have a maximum of the density in the center and the second-type ones have a minimum. When the defect is coupled with the boundary, the bound states are transformed correspondingly into resonances of two types and take up the form of the edge states flowing around the defect. Under certain conditions, two resonances interfere, giving rise to the formation of a bound state embedded into the continuum spectrum of the edge states flowing around the defect. We calculate the spatial distribution of the electron density in the edge states flowing around the defect and estimate the charge accumulated near the defect. The current density field of the edge states flowing around the defect contains two components, one of which flows around the defect and the other circulates around it.},

Their localized magnetic moments induce so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states inside the energy gap of the substrate. In the dilute limit, where the electronic states of the array atoms are only weakly coupled, proximity of the YSR states to the Fermi energy is essential for the formation of topological superconductivity in the band of YSR states. Here, we reveal via scanning tunnel spectroscopy and ab initio calculations of a series of 3d transition metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co) adsorbed on the heavy-element superconductor Re that the increase of the Kondo coupling and sign change in magnetic anisotropy with d-state filling is accompanied by a shift of the YSR states through the energy gap of the substrate and a crossing of the Fermi level. The uncovered systematic trends enable the identification of the most promising candidates for the realization of topological superconductivity in arrays of similar systems.},

  abstract = {The present research was aimed at exploiting and evaluating the potentialities of FT-NIR microscopy, as a complementary approach to analysis in the MIR region, for the chemical characterisation of paint cross sections. Even if FT-NIR technique is still underutilised in the field of cultural heritage investigations, the integrated use of information recorded in the NIR and in the MIR regions proved to be extremely useful in the molecular investigation of organic and inorganic substances. In fact, combination and overtone bands present in the NIR region, even if weaker and less selective than those in the MIR region, are not distorted by reflection phenomena. Furthermore, NIR spectra can be efficiently used as a spectral fingerprint for the stratigraphic characterisation of paint cross sections. The proposed analytical protocol was applied on two historical samples, presenting different stratigraphic structures. Suitable chemometric methods were applied for the elaboration of multivariate chemical maps recorded in the range 700–7500cm−1. In particular, a comprehensive and efficient procedure based on an interactive brushing approach, which combines the structural information of the score scatter plots with the spatial information of the PC score maps, was used. Interestingly, NIR data allowed a thorough characterisation of paint structures, providing information for the identification of components and suggesting the differentiation among different types of proteins. Moreover, NIR spectra permitted to achieve an efficient distinction of different classes of natural resins, demonstrating that, even working at a microscopic level, the NIR region may support the identification of different terpenoid materials. Multivariate analysis performed on MIR data did not provide satisfactory results, probably due to the distortion of the spectra and overlapping of bands. Nevertheless, MIR outcomes were investigated to support the interpretation of NIR spectra and in attempt to define an integrated protocol for the characterisation of complex paint mixtures.},

  abstract = {Recent decisions by leading AI labs to either open-source their models or to restrict access to their models has sparked debate about whether, and how, increasingly capable AI models should be shared. Open-sourcing in AI typically refers to making model architecture and weights freely and publicly accessible for anyone to modify, study, build on, and use. This offers advantages such as enabling external oversight, accelerating progress, and decentralizing control over AI development and use. However, it also presents a growing potential for misuse and unintended consequences. This paper offers an examination of the risks and benefits of open-sourcing highly capable foundation models. While open-sourcing has historically provided substantial net benefits for most software and AI development processes, we argue that for some highly capable foundation models likely to be developed in the near future, open-sourcing may pose sufficiently extreme risks to outweigh the benefits. In such a case, highly capable foundation models should not be open-sourced, at least not initially. Alternative strategies, including non-open-source model sharing options, are explored. The paper concludes with recommendations for developers, standard-setting bodies, and governments for establishing safe and responsible model sharing practices and preserving open-source benefits where safe.},

Here, we present evidence that this structure is given by the meta-dynamics of belief updating over hidden states of the data-generating process. Leveraging the theory of optimal prediction, we anticipate and then find that belief states are linearly represented in the residual stream of transformers, even in cases where the predicted belief state geometry has highly nontrivial fractal structure. We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a general framework connecting the structure of training data to the geometric structure of activations inside transformers.},

Here, transport measurements on AuSn               4               single crystals, a topological nodal-line semimetal candidate, reveal the presence of two-dimensional superconductivity with a transition temperature T               c               \textasciitilde{} 2.40\,K. The two-dimensional nature of superconductivity is verified by a Berezinsky–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, Bose-metal phase, and vortex dynamics interpreted in terms of thermally-assisted flux motion in two dimensions. The normal-state magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is found to be well described by the weak-antilocalization transport formula, which has been commonly observed in topological materials, strongly supporting the scenario that normal-state magnetotransport in AuSn               4               is dominated by the surface electrons of topological Dirac-cone states. The entire results are summarized in a phase diagram in the temperature–magnetic field plane, which displays different regimes of transport. The combination of two-dimensional superconductivity and surface-driven magnetotransport suggests the topological nature of superconductivity in AuSn               4               .},

  abstract = {The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination \& toxicity, (2) Privacy \& security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors \& misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic \& environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, \& limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.},

  abstract = {We characterize the topological insulator Bi2Se3 using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. By employing two-photon photoemission, a complete picture of the unoccupied electronic structure from the Fermi level up to the vacuum level is obtained. We demonstrate that the unoccupied states host a second Dirac surface state which can be resonantly excited by 1.5eV photons. We then study the ultrafast relaxation processes following optical excitation. We find that they culminate in a persistent non-equilibrium population of the first Dirac surface state, which is maintained by a meta-stable population of the bulk conduction band. Finally, we perform a temperature-dependent study of the electron–phonon scattering processes in the conduction band, and find the unexpected result that their rates decrease with increasing sample temperature. We develop a model of phonon emission and absorption from a population of electrons, and show that this counter-intuitive trend is the natural consequence of fundamental electron–phonon scattering processes. This analysis serves as an important reminder that the decay rates extracted by time-resolved photoemission are not in general equal to single electron scattering rates, but include contributions from filling and emptying processes from a continuum of states.},

(1979) of superconductivity in the high-effective-mass (∼200⁢𝑚𝑒) electrons in CeCu2Si2, the search for and characterization of such "heavy-fermion" systems has been a rapidly growing field of study. The eight heavy-fermion systems known to date include superconductors (CeCu2Si2, UBe13, UPt3), magnets (NpBe13, U2Zn17, UCd11), and materials in which no ordering is observed (CeAl3, CeCu6). These 𝑓-electron materials have, in comparison to normal metals, enormous specific heat 𝛾 values (450-1600 mJ/mol K2), large values of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility 𝜒 (8-50×10−3 emu/mol G), maxima in the resistivity at low temperatures with large 𝜌max values (100-200 μΩ cm), and unusual temperature dependences of their specific heats below 10 K. The three heavy-fermion superconductors show such unusual behavior that the possibility of 𝑝-wave pairing of the superconducting electrons, rather than the usual BCS 𝑠-wave pairing, cannot be ruled out. This paper reviews the experimental results to date, to serve both as a status report and as a starting point for future research. Several correlations between properties are pointed out, including the observation that a low value of the Wilson ratio (∼𝜒𝛾) appears to correlate with the occurrence of superconductivity.},

  abstract = {The observation of vortices in superconductors was a major breakthrough in developing the conceptual background for superconducting applications. Each vortex carries a flux quantum, and the magnetic field radially decreases from the center. Techniques used to make magnetic field maps, such as magnetic decoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong type II superconductors allow penetration of the magnetic field over large distances, of order of the magnetic penetration depth \textbackslash lambda. Superconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes, there is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices are largely unknown at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies using neutron scattering give insight into the collective behavior. But the microscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain difficult to obtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the electronic density of states describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle and pair wavefunction properties. These are of order of the superconducting coherence length \textbackslash xi, which is much smaller than \textbackslash lambda. In principle, individual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field where vortex cores, of size \textbackslash xi, overlap. In this review, we describe recent advances in vortex imaging made with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We introduce the technique and discuss vortex images which reveal the influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on the internal structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in different materials and conditions, and the observation of vortex lattice melting.},

  abstract = {Quenched disorder may prevent the formation of the widely sought quantum spin-liquid states (QSLs) or mask their signatures by inducing a spin-glass state, which is why considerable experimental efforts are directed at purifying materials that may host QSLs. However, in geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, the largest class of materials in which QSLs are sought, the glass-transition temperature 𝑇𝑔 grows with decreasing the density of vacancy defects, accompanied by a simultaneous growth of the magnetic susceptibility. In this Letter, we develop a phenomenological theory of glass transitions and magnetic susceptibility in three-dimensional geometrically frustrated magnetic materials. We consider a model of a GF magnet in which the glass transition occurs in the absence of vacancies, e.g., due to other types of quenched disorder. We show that disorder that creates weak local perturbations, e.g., weak random strain, leads to the growth of the transition temperature 𝑇𝑔. By contrast, vacancies reduce 𝑇𝑔 for small vacancy concentrations. Another consequence of the presence of vacancies is the creation of quasispins, effective magnetic moments localized near the vacancies, that contribute to the magnetic susceptibility of the system together with the bulk spins. We show that increasing the vacancy density leads to an increase of the total magnetic susceptibility.},

  abstract = {The origin of the exceptionally strong superconductivity of cuprates remains a subject of debate after more than two decades of investigation. Here we follow a new lead: The onset temperature for superconductivity scales with the strength of the anomalous normal-state scattering that makes the resistivity linear in temperature. The same correlation between linear resistivity and Tc is found in organic superconductors, for which pairing is known to come from fluctuations of a nearby antiferromagnetic phase, and in pnictide superconductors, for which an antiferromagnetic scenario is also likely. In the cuprates, the question is whether the pseudogap phase plays the corresponding role, with its fluctuations responsible for pairing and scattering. We review recent studies that shed light on this phase—its boundary, its quantum critical point, and its broken symmetries. The emerging picture is that of a phase with spin-density-wave order and fluctuations, in broad analogy with organic, pnictide, and heavy-fermion superconductors.},

The recent development of phase-sensitive tests, combined with the refinement of several other symmetry-sensitive techniques, has for the most part settled this controversy in favor of predominantly 𝑑-wave symmetry for a number of optimally hole- and electron-doped cuprates. This paper begins by reviewing the concepts of the order parameter, symmetry breaking, and symmetry classification in the context of the cuprates. After a brief survey of some of the key non-phase-sensitive tests of pairing symmetry, the authors extensively review the phase-sensitive methods, which use the half-integer flux-quantum effect as an unambiguous signature for 𝑑-wave pairing symmetry. A number of related symmetry-sensitive experiments are described. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications, both fundamental and applied, of the predominantly 𝑑-wave pairing symmetry in the cuprates.},

Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare electronic structure calculations of the NV-1 center in diamond with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.},

In strong tunneling conditions, the incommensurate CDW is depinned from impurities by the electric field from the STM tip. To explore the possible mechanism of this incommensurate CDW, we perform STM-based inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) to detect phonon excitations in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2 and measure the influence of atomic impurities on local phonon excitations. In comparison with the calculated vibrational density of states in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2, we find two branches of phonon excitations which correspond to the vibrations of Nb ions and S ions, and the strength of the local phonon excitations is insensitive to the atomic impurities. Our results demonstrate the coexistence of impurity-pinned incommensurate CDW and superconductivity in 2⁢𝐻−NbS2, and open a way for detecting atomic-scale phonon excitations in transition metal dichalcogenides with STM-based IETS.},

Heavy fermion metals — intermetallic compounds of rare earth metals (such as Ce, Sm and Yb) and actinides (such as U, Np and Pu) — are prototype systems for complex and collective quantum states; they exhibit both a lattice Kondo effect and antiferromagnetic correlations. These materials show unexpected phenomena; for example, they display unconventional superconductivity (beyond Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory) and unconventional quantum criticality (beyond the Landau framework). In this Review, we focus on systems in which Landau's Fermi-liquid theory does not apply. Heavy fermion metals and semiconductors are well suited for the study of strong electronic correlations, because the relevant energy scales (for charge carriers, magnetic excitations and lattice dynamics) are well separated from each other, allowing the exploration of concomitant physical phenomena almost independently. Thus, the study of these materials also provides valuable insight for the understanding — and tailoring — of other correlated systems.},

  abstract = {Quasiparticles are a powerful concept of condensed matter quantum theory. In this review, the appearence and the properties of quasiparticles are presented in a unifying perspective. The principles behind the existence of quasiparticle excitations in both quantum disordered and ordered phases of fermionic and bosonic systems are discussed. The lifetime of quasiparticles is considered in particular near a continuous classical or quantum phase transition, when the nature of quasiparticles on both sides of a transition into an ordered state changes. A new concept of critical quasiparticles near a quantum critical point is introduced, and applied to quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion metals. Fractional quasiparticles in systems of restricted dimensionality are reviewed. Dirac quasiparticles emerging in so-called Dirac materials are discussed. The more recent discoveries of topologically protected chiral quasiparticles in topological matter and Majorana quasiparticles in topological superconductors are briefly reviewed.},

  abstract = {Defects with associated electron and nuclear spins in solid-state materials have a long history relevant to quantum information science going back to the first spin echo experiments with silicon dopants in the 1950s. Since the turn of the century, the field has rapidly spread to a vast array of defects and host crystals applicable to quantum communication, sensing, and computing. From simple spin resonance to long-distance remote entanglement, the complexity of working with spin defects is fast advancing, and requires an in-depth understanding of their spin, optical, charge, and material properties in this modern context. This is especially critical for discovering new relevant systems dedicated to specific quantum applications. In this review, we therefore expand upon all the key components with an emphasis on the properties of defects and the host material,on engineering opportunities and other pathways for improvement. Finally, this review aims to be as defect and material agnostic as possible, with some emphasis on optical emitters,providing a broad guideline for the field of solid-state spin defects for quantum information.},

One suggestion is that superconductivity in these materials has a magnetic origin, which would imply a sign-reversal s± pairing symmetry. Another suggests it is the result of orbital fluctuations, which would imply a sign-equal s++ pairing symmetry. There is no consensus yet which of these two distinct and contrasting pairing symmetries is the right one in iron pnictide superconductors. Here we explore the nature of the pairing symmetry in the superconducting state of Na(Fe0.97−xCo0.03Cux)As by probing the effect of scattering of Cooper pairs by non-magnetic Cu impurities. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we identify the in-gap quasiparticle states induced by the Cu impurities, showing signatures of Cooper pair breaking by these non-magnetic impurities–a process that is only consistent with s± pairing. This experiment provides strong evidence for the s± pairing.},

  abstract = {Dislocations are ubiquitous in three-dimensional solid-state materials. The interplay of such real space topology with the emergent band topology defined in reciprocal space gives rise to gapless helical modes bound to the line defects. This is known as bulk-dislocation correspondence, in contrast to the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence featuring topological states at boundaries. However, to date rare compelling experimental evidences have been presented for this intriguing topological observable in solid-state systems, owing to the huge challenges in creating controllable dislocations and conclusively identifying topological signals. Here, using a three-dimensional acoustic weak topological insulator with precisely controllable dislocations, we report an unambiguous experimental evidence for the long-desired bulk-dislocation correspondence, through directly measuring the gapless dispersion of the one-dimensional topological dislocation modes. Remarkably, as revealed in our further experiments, the pseudospin-locked dislocation modes can be unidirectionally guided in an arbitrarily-shaped dislocation path. The peculiar topological dislocation transport, expected in a variety of classical wave systems, can provide unprecedented control over wave propagations.},

  abstract = {Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn4 has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn4, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.},

Scanning tunnelling microscopy can be used to probe various topological phenomena, as well as complement results from other techniques. We discuss some of these proof-of-principle methodologies applied to probe topology, with particular attention to studies performed under a tunable vector magnetic field, which is a relatively new direction of recent focus.

Their room-temperature conductivity can exceed that of Au, while their low-temperature electronic mean-free-paths reach an astonishing 20 μm. It is widely accepted that these materials must be ultrapure to achieve this, although the methods for their growth (which produce only small crystals) are not typically capable of such. Here, we report a different approach to PdCoO               2               crystal growth, using chemical vapor transport methods to achieve order-of-magnitude gains in size, the highest structural qualities yet reported, and record residual resistivity ratios (\,{$>$}\,440). Nevertheless, detailed mass spectrometry measurements on these materials reveal that they are not ultrapure in a general sense, typically harboring 100s-of-parts-per-million impurity levels. Through quantitative crystal-chemical analyses, we resolve this apparent dichotomy, showing that the vast majority of impurities are forced to reside in the Co-O octahedral layers, leaving the conductive Pd sheets highly pure (∼1 ppm impurity concentrations). These purities are shown to be in quantitative agreement with measured residual resistivities. We thus conclude that a sublattice purification mechanism is essential to the ultrahigh low-temperature conductivity and mean-free-path of metallic delafossites.},

This problem is ill-posed without further constraints or priors. This paper studies the situation where the nonzero entries in the activation signal are sparsely and randomly populated. We normalize the convolution kernel to have unit Frobenius norm and cast the sparse blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. With this spherical constraint, every spurious local minimum turns out to be close to some signed shift truncation of the ground truth, under certain hypotheses. This benign property motivates an effective two stage algorithm that recovers the ground truth from the partial information offered by a suboptimal local minimum. This geometry-inspired algorithm recovers the ground truth for certain microscopy problems, also exhibits promising performance in the more challenging image deblurring problem. Our insights into the global geometry and the two stage algorithm extend to the convolutional dictionary learning problem, where a superposition of multiple convolution signals is observed.},

  abstract = {Quasiparticle interference (QPI) of the electronic states has been widely applied in scanning tunneling microscopy to analyze the electronic band structure of materials. Single-defect-induced QPI reveals defect-dependent interaction between a single atomic defect and electronic states, which deserves special attention. Due to the weak signal of single-defect-induced QPI, the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively low in a standard two-dimensional QPI measurement. In this paper, we introduce a projective quasiparticle interference (PQPI) method in which a one-dimensional measurement is taken along high-symmetry directions centered on a specified defect. We apply the PQPI method to the topological nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. We focus on two special types of atomic defects that scatter the surface and bulk electronic bands. With an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in PQPI, the energy dispersions are clearly resolved along high-symmetry directions. We discuss the defect-dependent scattering of bulk bands with the nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced selection rules. Furthermore, an energy shift of the surface floating band is observed, and a branch of energy dispersion (𝒒6) is resolved. This PQPI method can be applied to other complex materials to explore defect-dependent interactions in the future.},

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals may open a new era in condensed matter physics, materials science, and nanotechnology after graphene and topological insulators. We report the first atomic scale view of the surface states of a Weyl semimetal (NbP) using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe coherent quantum interference patterns that arise from the scattering of quasiparticles near point defects on the surface. The measurements reveal the surface electronic structure both below and above the chemical potential in both real and reciprocal spaces. Moreover, the interference maps uncover the scattering processes of NbP’s exotic surface states. Through comparison between experimental data and theoretical calculations, we further discover that the orbital and/or spin texture of the surface bands may suppress certain scattering channels on NbP. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of electronic properties on Weyl semimetal surfaces.},
